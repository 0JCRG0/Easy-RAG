====

3. Celestica's capital expenditure plans, including the construction of additional capacity in Thailand and Malaysia, signal the company's anticipation of continued demand strength through 2024 and into 2025.

The significance of Celestica's capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue is an indicator of the company's investment in its operational capabilities and future growth. An increase in capital expenditures suggests that the company is investing more heavily in expanding its capacity, upgrading technology, or entering new markets. Here are three possible interpretations of the expected increase in Celestica's capital expenditures:

1. **Expansion of Capacity**: The expected increase in capital expenditures to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues indicates that Celestica is expanding its capacity. This is evidenced by the construction of over 100,000 square feet of additional capacity in Thailand and more than 80,000 square feet in Malaysia to support demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs. This expansion suggests that Celestica is preparing for anticipated growth in demand from its customers, particularly in the areas of data center products and services for hyperscaler clients.
   ====
2. **Investment in Advanced Technologies**: The capital expenditure increase also signifies Celestica's commitment to investing in advanced technologies. The company is building out facilities that are highly automated, such as the AI/ML testing facility in Thailand, which is expected to enhance productivity and support the company's growth in complex product segments. This aligns with the company's strategic focus on high-growth areas like AI/ML compute capacity, indicating that Celestica is positioning itself to remain competitive in these advanced technology markets.
   ====
3. **Strategic Co-Investments with Customers**: The capital expenditure increase reflects strategic co-investments with key customers, such as the co-investment with a hyperscaler customer in Thailand. This collaborative approach to facility expansion demonstrates Celestica's strong customer relationships and its role as a strategic partner in supporting its customers' growth plans. It also suggests that Celestica is securing its position as a preferred supplier for future projects, which could lead to sustained revenue growth and stronger customer loyalty.

The significance of Celestica's capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue is an indicator of the company's investment in its operational capabilities and future growth. Capital expenditures represent the money the company spends to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment. A higher percentage suggests that the company is investing more relative to its revenue, which could be indicative of expansion efforts, technological upgrades, or increased production capacity.

====

The expected increase in capital expenditures indicates that Celestica is planning to expand its capacity and capabilities, particularly in areas that are experiencing strong demand. For instance, the company is gearing up for capacity expansions at key sites to support demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs. This suggests that Celestica is anticipating continued growth in these areas and is investing to ensure it can meet customer demand.

====

The increase in capital expenditures to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues, with a higher level of spend in the first half of the year, signals that Celestica is proactively investing in its infrastructure to support anticipated growth. The specific mention of building out over 100,000 square feet of additional capacity in Thailand and more than 80,000 square feet in Malaysia to support strong demand from customers in the CCS segment, including HPS business, indicates a strategic plan to enhance production capabilities in response to customer needs and market opportunities.

The significance of Celestica's capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue is an indicator of the company's investment in its operational capabilities and future growth. Capital expenditures represent the money the company spends to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment. A higher percentage suggests that the company is investing more relative to its revenue, which could be indicative of expansion efforts, technological upgrades, or increased production capacity.

====

The expected increase in capital expenditures indicates that Celestica is planning to expand its capacity and capabilities, particularly in areas that are experiencing strong demand. For instance, the company is gearing up for capacity expansions at key sites to support demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs. This suggests that Celestica is anticipating continued growth in these areas and is investing to ensure it can meet customer demand.

====

The increase in capital expenditures to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues, with a higher level of spend in the first half of the year, signals that Celestica is proactively investing in its future. The specific mention of building out over 100,000 square feet of additional capacity in Thailand and more than 80,000 square feet in Malaysia to support strong demand from customers in the CCS segment, including HPS business, indicates a strategic focus on scaling up operations to capitalize on emerging market opportunities.

The significance of Celestica's capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue is an indicator of the company's investment in its operational capabilities and future growth. An increase in capital expenditures suggests that the company is investing more heavily in expanding its capacity, upgrading technology, or entering new markets. Here are three possible interpretations of the expected increase in Celestica's capital expenditures:

====

1. The expected increase in capital expenditures to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues indicates that Celestica is planning to expand its capacity and capabilities, particularly in areas that are experiencing strong demand, such as AI/ML compute and HPS programs. This investment is likely aimed at supporting sustained growth and maintaining a competitive edge in these high-growth areas.

====

2. The increase in capital expenditures reflects Celestica's strategic plans to build out additional capacity at key sites, such as the expansion in Thailand and Malaysia. This is in response to customer demand and co-investment with a hyperscaler customer, suggesting a focus on long-term partnerships and the ability to meet the evolving needs of significant clients in the data center and cloud services space.

====

3. Celestica's capital expenditure plans, including the construction of new facilities and expansion of existing ones, signal a proactive approach to scaling operations in anticipation of continued demand from its customer base, particularly hyperscalers. This forward-looking investment strategy is indicative of management's confidence in the company's growth trajectory and commitment to meeting future demand.

The significance of Celestica's capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue is an indicator of the company's investment in its own growth and operational capacity. An increase in capital expenditures suggests that the company is investing more heavily in its infrastructure, which could be for expanding production capabilities, upgrading technology, or entering new markets. In the context of Celestica, the expected increase in capital expenditures indicates that the company is planning to expand its capacity to meet growing demand, particularly from its hyperscaler customers for AI/ML compute and HPS programs. This is evidenced by the construction of additional capacity in Thailand and Malaysia, with phases expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2024 and the first half of 2025, respectively. These expansions are partially funded by co-investment with a hyperscaler customer, which underscores the strategic nature of these investments in supporting long-term customer relationships and demand.

====
The expected increase in Celestica's capital expenditures to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues for 2024, up from 1.6% in the previous year, indicates that the company is preparing for future growth and demand. This is particularly relevant as the company is building out significant additional capacity in Thailand and Malaysia to support demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs. The capital expenditure is not only a sign of growth but also of the company's commitment to maintaining a competitive edge by investing in the necessary infrastructure to support its customers' evolving needs, especially in the data center and hyperscaler markets.

====
Celestica's planned increase in capital expenditures reflects its strategic focus on scaling up operations to support anticipated demand from its key growth areas, such as AI/ML compute and HPS programs. The capital expenditure increase is a proactive measure to ensure that Celestica has the capacity to meet customer demand, particularly from its hyperscaler customers. This investment in capacity expansions at key sites demonstrates Celestica's commitment to its growth strategy and its confidence in the continued demand from its customers. The capital investments are expected to enhance the company's operational capabilities and position it to capitalize on market opportunities in the coming years.

2024-02-07 19:49:58,493 INFO: 
The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:9>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] As we look to 2024, we expect our capital expenditures to modestly increase to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues, with a higher level of spend in the first half of the year. Our increasing level of capital expenditures is geared towards capacity expansions at key sites in support of demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs.
---

<Reference ID:11>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] During the fourth quarter and for 2023, we had one customer, which accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, representing 29% for the quarter and 22% for the year. Celestica has a long standing relationship with this customer, a global hyperscaler that we have been supporting for well over a decade. We support this customer across 25 programs covering HPS and non-HPS products in the areas of networking and compute.
---

<Reference ID:69>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Yeah. And the customers in terms of their cycles to get that upgraded a little bit longer than the quarter-to-quarter discussions is, I mean it's obviously going to be demand dependent, but is that a two-year process or five-year process what's the mindset towards getting that upgrade complete? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] My sense is, it's a multi-year process. It's certainly five plus years. And again, across each of the hyperscalers that we're dealing with, each has different appetites and different phases for deployment so that they won't necessarily all overlap at once, which for at least for Celestica should give us many years of growth. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. I would add to that Todd. Again we support the top five hyperscalers, but not all the top five hyperscalers spend CapEx the same way and there's a couple in particular that sometimes are leading with the more complex technologies, and then the other hyperscalers sometimes follow. What we're really encouraged about is, where we're seeing a lot of our new winds come in and our demand outlook is with some of the hyperscalers that are at the leading edge of the more complex technologies. Hence, we're seeing the demand strengthen AI/ML computes, and we're seeing the wins come in on the 800G switches, some of which are starting to be shipped in ‘24, and then a lot more which will be shipped in 2025. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And as we see some of the other hyperscalers that follow behind that, it gives demands, it gives us an idea of the fact that this does have an opportunity to be a multi-year opportunity for us. And so when we -- and to Rob's point, we're really in the early stages right now of the AI/ML CapEx investment cycle. Of course nobody has visibility 10 years out on what things are going to look like, but we are seeing demand signals at least for the next two or three years. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And I would just close with, the adoption of some custom silicon is going to drive compute programs, and that's going to accelerate in the future. And then investments in AI is also going to drive advanced networking and that's going to be a driver in the future. And then also with our enterprise customers, we expect to see the Internet traffic is going to drive improvements in data center interconnect as well. So this whole upgrade cycle I think has a long life to it.---

<Reference ID:64>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.
---

<Reference ID:47>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Now turning to our CCS segment. The demand backdrop for our CCS segment continues to be very strong. Investments from hyperscalers and data center infrastructure are fueling significant CapEx spending, driven by growing demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. In 2023, our portfolio with our hyperscalers saw revenue growth of 32% compared to 2022, recording nearly $2.9 billion in revenues. This accounted for 62% of our total CCS segment revenues in 2023, up from 51% the prior year.
---

<Reference ID:39>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] At our recent Virtual Investor meeting in November, we delved further into this dynamic, which we believe is long-term and structural in nature. We anticipate this solid growth to continue in 2024 and believe that this investment cycle has the potential to support several years of strong demand for our CCS segment. The demand outlook for our enterprise and market continues to be impressive as the beneficiary of hyperscaler's growing deployment of AI/ML compute capacity.
---

<Reference ID:17>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] In Thailand, we are currently building out over 100,000 square feet of additional capacity, with the first phase expected to be online in the first quarter of 2024, and the second phase expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. This expansion is being partially funded by a co-investment with one of our hyperscaler customers to facilitate demand for highly specialized data center products.
---

<Reference ID:10>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Capital expenditures for the quarter were $33 million or approximately 1.5% of revenue, compared with 1.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, capital expenditures were $125 million or 1.6% of revenue as we continue to invest in growth across our network to support customer demand.
---

<Reference ID:59>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Pro CCS, okay. Perfect. And then the capacity adds in Thailand and Malaysia. Rob, could you give us a ballpark in terms of the revenue production capacity in each of those or combined? And is that incremental revenue where there are basically new programs or new capacity versus shifting from another region? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Look, what I can tell you, Matt is, how much square foot we're adding and that the capacity improvements are a couple of folds. One, phase 1, if you will, which is coming online this quarter is about 28,000 square feet of manufacturing space. It's really a AI/ML testing facility. So it's a test farm -- for fully automated test farm for all AI/ML products. So that's coming online right about now. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And then phase 2 will be the first half of 2025 and that's a combined productivity play of where we're combining all our warehousing in Thailand into one facility to save on space and drive productivity and also adding about 156,000 I mean 130,000 of plus of manufacturing space, which is going to support existing and new customers as well largely around AI/ML. And we think those capacity expansions should take care of us through the next couple of years of growth.
---

<Reference ID:13>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Finally, in our enterprise end market, we expect revenue to be up in the high-60s percentage range year-over-year, driven by anticipated demand growth in AI/ML compute programs from our hyperscaler customers.
---

<Reference ID:52>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] We're seeing the strong momentum from 2023 continue, and as mentioned earlier, we anticipate significant growth within our AI/ML compute portfolio as we enter 2024. We expect additional growth in our storage business to materialize in the latter half of the year, driven by demand from new programs. After experiencing some softness in 2023, demand in our communications end market is anticipated to resume year-to-year growth in the first quarter, driven by a resumption of strength in networking demand from hyperscalers, which is expected to persist throughout the year.
---

<Reference ID:7>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And in Malaysia, we are building more than 80,000 square feet of capacity to support strong demand from customers in our CCS segment, including our HPS business. This edition is expected to be online in the first half of 2024.

<Reference ID:68>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Hi. Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I want to step back from these detailed questions and just ask a question on the hyperscaler market, data -- the global data center market. What's your view on how much of the data center hyperscaler market has been upgraded to support generative AI and large language model processing needs? How far into that cycle would you think we are at this point? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Good morning, Todd. That's a very good question. I would say, we're still in the early innings of the upgrade cycle. I mean, and I say that by the fact that it just started about a year or so ago, and given the amount of compute, which makes up about 50% of any data center that needs to kind of get upgraded, I think we're still in the very early innings of that upgrade cycle.
---

<Reference ID:32>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] The products we build are highly complex, and as a result, the majority of these programs are single sourced. In addition, we are pleased that as a result of our strength in engineering and solid operational execution, we continue to win new programs with this customer and expect to see demand strength continue through 2024 and into 2025.

<Reference ID:3>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] Good morning and thank you for joining us on Celestica’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Rob Mionis, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mandeep Chawla, Chief Financial Officer.
---

<Reference ID:15>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] I'll now turn the call back over to Rob to discuss the outlook for each of our end markets and the overall business.

The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:6>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] We refer you to yesterday’s press release and our Q4 2023 earnings presentation, which are available at celestica.com under the Investor Relations tab, for more information about these and certain other non-IFRS financial measures, including a reconciliation of historical non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures from our financial statements and a description of recent modifications to specified non-IFRS financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, all references to dollars on this call are to U.S. dollars and per share information is based on diluted shares outstanding.
---

<Reference ID:9>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] As we look to 2024, we expect our capital expenditures to modestly increase to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues, with a higher level of spend in the first half of the year. Our increasing level of capital expenditures is geared towards capacity expansions at key sites in support of demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs.
---

<Reference ID:10>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Capital expenditures for the quarter were $33 million or approximately 1.5% of revenue, compared with 1.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, capital expenditures were $125 million or 1.6% of revenue as we continue to invest in growth across our network to support customer demand.
---

<Reference ID:3>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] Good morning and thank you for joining us on Celestica’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Rob Mionis, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mandeep Chawla, Chief Financial Officer.
---

<Reference ID:11>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] During the fourth quarter and for 2023, we had one customer, which accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, representing 29% for the quarter and 22% for the year. Celestica has a long standing relationship with this customer, a global hyperscaler that we have been supporting for well over a decade. We support this customer across 25 programs covering HPS and non-HPS products in the areas of networking and compute.
---

<Reference ID:69>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Yeah. And the customers in terms of their cycles to get that upgraded a little bit longer than the quarter-to-quarter discussions is, I mean it's obviously going to be demand dependent, but is that a two-year process or five-year process what's the mindset towards getting that upgrade complete? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] My sense is, it's a multi-year process. It's certainly five plus years. And again, across each of the hyperscalers that we're dealing with, each has different appetites and different phases for deployment so that they won't necessarily all overlap at once, which for at least for Celestica should give us many years of growth. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. I would add to that Todd. Again we support the top five hyperscalers, but not all the top five hyperscalers spend CapEx the same way and there's a couple in particular that sometimes are leading with the more complex technologies, and then the other hyperscalers sometimes follow. What we're really encouraged about is, where we're seeing a lot of our new winds come in and our demand outlook is with some of the hyperscalers that are at the leading edge of the more complex technologies. Hence, we're seeing the demand strengthen AI/ML computes, and we're seeing the wins come in on the 800G switches, some of which are starting to be shipped in ‘24, and then a lot more which will be shipped in 2025. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And as we see some of the other hyperscalers that follow behind that, it gives demands, it gives us an idea of the fact that this does have an opportunity to be a multi-year opportunity for us. And so when we -- and to Rob's point, we're really in the early stages right now of the AI/ML CapEx investment cycle. Of course nobody has visibility 10 years out on what things are going to look like, but we are seeing demand signals at least for the next two or three years. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And I would just close with, the adoption of some custom silicon is going to drive compute programs, and that's going to accelerate in the future. And then investments in AI is also going to drive advanced networking and that's going to be a driver in the future. And then also with our enterprise customers, we expect to see the Internet traffic is going to drive improvements in data center interconnect as well. So this whole upgrade cycle I think has a long life to it.---

<Reference ID:47>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Now turning to our CCS segment. The demand backdrop for our CCS segment continues to be very strong. Investments from hyperscalers and data center infrastructure are fueling significant CapEx spending, driven by growing demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. In 2023, our portfolio with our hyperscalers saw revenue growth of 32% compared to 2022, recording nearly $2.9 billion in revenues. This accounted for 62% of our total CCS segment revenues in 2023, up from 51% the prior year.
---

<Reference ID:64>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.
---

<Reference ID:45>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In our capital equipment business, market forecasts continue to suggest that the underlying market demand is operating close to trough levels, and we should see flat to slightly higher demand in 2024. We are maintaining our outlook for modest revenue growth in our capital equipment business in 2024, supported by the ramping of new program wins and our assumption of base demand holding flag for 2023. We anticipate that the year-to-year growth will largely be in the back half of the year, setting up for a stronger recovery and demand in 2025.
---

<Reference ID:65>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Okay. Thank you. Yeah. And then the second question, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. You said you're going to revisit the full year outlook, I think in Q1, but the outlook for 5.5% to 6% operating margin seems conservative given, you're doing so well in the enterprise business in CCS at 6.7% and you're entering at 6% and the guide looks like 6%. So it looks as though it's going to decelerate in the back half of the year. Maybe if you could discuss that and I'll pass on. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Yeah, Rob. I'll talk about two things. one is the outlook for the full year and then I can talk to your point on margin specifically. So, when we look at full year 2024, we're really pleased with the way we ended ‘23. And clearly, we're off to a really hot start now into the first quarter. And again, encouraged by where we're seeing the demand signals come through, both on comms and HPS, but also the demand signals from the hyperscalers continue to strengthen. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] As you know, in November, we provided the outlook of $8.5 billion or more and $2.70 of EPS or more. And right now, we really do see that as being the floor. What we are looking to do, as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks is, we're going back out to the customer base and revalidating the second half outlook. We're seeing that increased strength happening in the first half and now what we want to do is go and validate whether or not those increasing level of demand signals are going to be added to the second half as well. And so, in April, we'll come back with an updated forecast. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] To your point on the margin profile itself, as we talked about, ATS is expected to see some very minor levels of declines in the first half of this year before resuming growth in the back end of the year. ATS, again, we're expecting across all of our end markets to have some level of growth in 2024. But because that growth in the back half is going to be off the back of ramping programs, there is going to be a little bit of margin challenges around there as well. Again, 6% for the first quarter, I believe the 270 is the floor. And obviously, we're going to be working towards the high end of that 5.5% to 6% range as best we can. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] And one other thing, I would add, Rob, I think by the end of the first quarter we'll have better visibility into capital equipment markets. We are seeing some signs of recovery. We're cautiously optimistic. Some of our customers are starting to restock consumables and spares, which is a good sign. So I think as capital equipment gets better, so will some of the ATS margins as well.
---

<Reference ID:59>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Pro CCS, okay. Perfect. And then the capacity adds in Thailand and Malaysia. Rob, could you give us a ballpark in terms of the revenue production capacity in each of those or combined? And is that incremental revenue where there are basically new programs or new capacity versus shifting from another region? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Look, what I can tell you, Matt is, how much square foot we're adding and that the capacity improvements are a couple of folds. One, phase 1, if you will, which is coming online this quarter is about 28,000 square feet of manufacturing space. It's really a AI/ML testing facility. So it's a test farm -- for fully automated test farm for all AI/ML products. So that's coming online right about now. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And then phase 2 will be the first half of 2025 and that's a combined productivity play of where we're combining all our warehousing in Thailand into one facility to save on space and drive productivity and also adding about 156,000 I mean 130,000 of plus of manufacturing space, which is going to support existing and new customers as well largely around AI/ML. And we think those capacity expansions should take care of us through the next couple of years of growth.
---

<Reference ID:39>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] At our recent Virtual Investor meeting in November, we delved further into this dynamic, which we believe is long-term and structural in nature. We anticipate this solid growth to continue in 2024 and believe that this investment cycle has the potential to support several years of strong demand for our CCS segment. The demand outlook for our enterprise and market continues to be impressive as the beneficiary of hyperscaler's growing deployment of AI/ML compute capacity.
---

<Reference ID:13>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Finally, in our enterprise end market, we expect revenue to be up in the high-60s percentage range year-over-year, driven by anticipated demand growth in AI/ML compute programs from our hyperscaler customers.
---

<Reference ID:7>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And in Malaysia, we are building more than 80,000 square feet of capacity to support strong demand from customers in our CCS segment, including our HPS business. This edition is expected to be online in the first half of 2024.
---

<Reference ID:53>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Within our HPS business, we anticipate to resume year-to-year growth in the first quarter of 2024 and for the full year. This growth is being fueled by a number of new program loans in both networking, supported by growth in our 400G and 800G platforms, and to some extent AI/ML compute. For 2024, we are maintaining our previously communicated expectation of low-double digit percentage revenue growth in our CCS segment, supported by solid growth in both our enterprise and communications end markets.
---

<Reference ID:17>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] In Thailand, we are currently building out over 100,000 square feet of additional capacity, with the first phase expected to be online in the first quarter of 2024, and the second phase expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. This expansion is being partially funded by a co-investment with one of our hyperscaler customers to facilitate demand for highly specialized data center products.
---

<Reference ID:55>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] Appreciate it. Thanks for that. And the final question, you also mentioned the ramp up of some of these sites. Just wondering whether you have enough capacity to deal with the near-term demand that's coming in throughout this year and how those discussions are going on your ability to service some of that demand? Thank you. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Yeah. Thanks. We've been interlocking with our customers and been investing forward on capacity expansions, mainly in Thailand. We have a couple of phases, and also in Malaysia, a phase is coming online in February, we've been cutting, frankly. So yes, we do have enough capacity, and it's coming online, very much aligned with the demand state, I would say. And these are also highly automated factories, highly automated test centers, so they're really producing a lot of productivity.

2024-02-07 19:55:37,439 INFO: 
The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:69>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Yeah. And the customers in terms of their cycles to get that upgraded a little bit longer than the quarter-to-quarter discussions is, I mean it's obviously going to be demand dependent, but is that a two-year process or five-year process what's the mindset towards getting that upgrade complete? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] My sense is, it's a multi-year process. It's certainly five plus years. And again, across each of the hyperscalers that we're dealing with, each has different appetites and different phases for deployment so that they won't necessarily all overlap at once, which for at least for Celestica should give us many years of growth. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. I would add to that Todd. Again we support the top five hyperscalers, but not all the top five hyperscalers spend CapEx the same way and there's a couple in particular that sometimes are leading with the more complex technologies, and then the other hyperscalers sometimes follow. What we're really encouraged about is, where we're seeing a lot of our new winds come in and our demand outlook is with some of the hyperscalers that are at the leading edge of the more complex technologies. Hence, we're seeing the demand strengthen AI/ML computes, and we're seeing the wins come in on the 800G switches, some of which are starting to be shipped in ‘24, and then a lot more which will be shipped in 2025. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And as we see some of the other hyperscalers that follow behind that, it gives demands, it gives us an idea of the fact that this does have an opportunity to be a multi-year opportunity for us. And so when we -- and to Rob's point, we're really in the early stages right now of the AI/ML CapEx investment cycle. Of course nobody has visibility 10 years out on what things are going to look like, but we are seeing demand signals at least for the next two or three years. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And I would just close with, the adoption of some custom silicon is going to drive compute programs, and that's going to accelerate in the future. And then investments in AI is also going to drive advanced networking and that's going to be a driver in the future. And then also with our enterprise customers, we expect to see the Internet traffic is going to drive improvements in data center interconnect as well. So this whole upgrade cycle I think has a long life to it.---

<Reference ID:64>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.

<Reference ID:65>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Okay. Thank you. Yeah. And then the second question, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. You said you're going to revisit the full year outlook, I think in Q1, but the outlook for 5.5% to 6% operating margin seems conservative given, you're doing so well in the enterprise business in CCS at 6.7% and you're entering at 6% and the guide looks like 6%. So it looks as though it's going to decelerate in the back half of the year. Maybe if you could discuss that and I'll pass on. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Yeah, Rob. I'll talk about two things. one is the outlook for the full year and then I can talk to your point on margin specifically. So, when we look at full year 2024, we're really pleased with the way we ended ‘23. And clearly, we're off to a really hot start now into the first quarter. And again, encouraged by where we're seeing the demand signals come through, both on comms and HPS, but also the demand signals from the hyperscalers continue to strengthen. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] As you know, in November, we provided the outlook of $8.5 billion or more and $2.70 of EPS or more. And right now, we really do see that as being the floor. What we are looking to do, as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks is, we're going back out to the customer base and revalidating the second half outlook. We're seeing that increased strength happening in the first half and now what we want to do is go and validate whether or not those increasing level of demand signals are going to be added to the second half as well. And so, in April, we'll come back with an updated forecast. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] To your point on the margin profile itself, as we talked about, ATS is expected to see some very minor levels of declines in the first half of this year before resuming growth in the back end of the year. ATS, again, we're expecting across all of our end markets to have some level of growth in 2024. But because that growth in the back half is going to be off the back of ramping programs, there is going to be a little bit of margin challenges around there as well. Again, 6% for the first quarter, I believe the 270 is the floor. And obviously, we're going to be working towards the high end of that 5.5% to 6% range as best we can. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] And one other thing, I would add, Rob, I think by the end of the first quarter we'll have better visibility into capital equipment markets. We are seeing some signs of recovery. We're cautiously optimistic. Some of our customers are starting to restock consumables and spares, which is a good sign. So I think as capital equipment gets better, so will some of the ATS margins as well.

<Reference ID:59>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Pro CCS, okay. Perfect. And then the capacity adds in Thailand and Malaysia. Rob, could you give us a ballpark in terms of the revenue production capacity in each of those or combined? And is that incremental revenue where there are basically new programs or new capacity versus shifting from another region? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Look, what I can tell you, Matt is, how much square foot we're adding and that the capacity improvements are a couple of folds. One, phase 1, if you will, which is coming online this quarter is about 28,000 square feet of manufacturing space. It's really a AI/ML testing facility. So it's a test farm -- for fully automated test farm for all AI/ML products. So that's coming online right about now. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And then phase 2 will be the first half of 2025 and that's a combined productivity play of where we're combining all our warehousing in Thailand into one facility to save on space and drive productivity and also adding about 156,000 I mean 130,000 of plus of manufacturing space, which is going to support existing and new customers as well largely around AI/ML. And we think those capacity expansions should take care of us through the next couple of years of growth.

<Reference ID:55>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] Appreciate it. Thanks for that. And the final question, you also mentioned the ramp up of some of these sites. Just wondering whether you have enough capacity to deal with the near-term demand that's coming in throughout this year and how those discussions are going on your ability to service some of that demand? Thank you. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Yeah. Thanks. We've been interlocking with our customers and been investing forward on capacity expansions, mainly in Thailand. We have a couple of phases, and also in Malaysia, a phase is coming online in February, we've been cutting, frankly. So yes, we do have enough capacity, and it's coming online, very much aligned with the demand state, I would say. And these are also highly automated factories, highly automated test centers, so they're really producing a lot of productivity.

---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Hi. Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I want to step back from these detailed questions and just ask a question on the hyperscaler market, data -- the global data center market. What's your view on how much of the data center hyperscaler market has been upgraded to support generative AI and large language model processing needs? How far into that cycle would you think we are at this point? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Good morning, Todd. That's a very good question. I would say, we're still in the early innings of the upgrade cycle. I mean, and I say that by the fact that it just started about a year or so ago, and given the amount of compute, which makes up about 50% of any data center that needs to kind of get upgraded, I think we're still in the very early innings of that upgrade cycle.

---Extract: (Q&A)[Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Hi. Good morning. With respect to the full year guidance, I hear you with respect to wanting to discuss the second half outlook with your customers before revisiting the guidance. But certainly from the demand signals, you're highlighting it seems like it'll be a stronger second half. I guess from your perspective, what might be the key areas of uncertainty you want to further color on before visiting guidance? Would that be on semi and industrial, or which areas would be the biggest source of demand variability as you think about second half? (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Yeah. Hi, Thanos. Mandeep here. So we were pleased to be able to interlock with our customer base, specifically on the hyperscaler side in the fourth quarter, and that has led us to confidently come out with the outlook that we did. Even after our virtual investor meeting in November, we saw incremental improvement to the forecast coming from the hyperscalers, and so that's reflected in our Q1 guidance. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Again, our outlook is for 14% year-over-year growth, which is higher than what we would have said probably in November. And we're seeing that demand strength continue into the second quarter. So the conversations with the hyperscalers are, is there an improvement in material availability on your end? Is there -- has your deployment change -- plans changed at all? And how does that impact the second half of the year? Is it going to be similar to what we're seeing right now in the first half of the year?

Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.

The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:66>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Hi. Good morning. With respect to the full year guidance, I hear you with respect to wanting to discuss the second half outlook with your customers before revisiting the guidance. But certainly from the demand signals, you're highlighting it seems like it'll be a stronger second half. I guess from your perspective, what might be the key areas of uncertainty you want to further color on before visiting guidance? Would that be on semi and industrial, or which areas would be the biggest source of demand variability as you think about second half? (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Yeah. Hi, Thanos. Mandeep here. So we were pleased to be able to interlock with our customer base, specifically on the hyperscaler side in the fourth quarter, and that has led us to confidently come out with the outlook that we did. Even after our virtual investor meeting in November, we saw incremental improvement to the forecast coming from the hyperscalers, and so that's reflected in our Q1 guidance. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Again, our outlook is for 14% year-over-year growth, which is higher than what we would have said probably in November. And we're seeing that demand strength continue into the second quarter. So the conversations with the hyperscalers are, is there an improvement in material availability on your end? Is there -- has your deployment change -- plans changed at all? And how does that impact the second half of the year? Is it going to be similar to what we're seeing right now in the first half of the year?

---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Hi. Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I want to step back from these detailed questions and just ask a question on the hyperscaler market, data -- the global data center market. What's your view on how much of the data center hyperscaler market has been upgraded to support generative AI and large language model processing needs? How far into that cycle would you think we are at this point? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Good morning, Todd. That's a very good question. I would say, we're still in the early innings of the upgrade cycle. I mean, and I say that by the fact that it just started about a year or so ago, and given the amount of compute, which makes up about 50% of any data center that needs to kind of get upgraded, I think we're still in the very early innings of that upgrade cycle.

<Reference ID:57>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] And so based on that, would you expect the Q2 to be up sequentially then again? (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] On a revenue basis, yes. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yes. We would expect higher revenues in Q2 than we do in Q1.

---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.

---Extract: (Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] Hi. Good morning. Congrats on a strong quarter here. So communications was stronger than expected this quarter, was that driven by AI demand strength or was that from non-AI related cloud demand where we're also starting to see some early signs of recovery? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In terms of comms, it was driven by networking, which is kind of the pull through that we've been mentioning that we would see as a result of AI/ML demand. And within networking, there's, I'll call it, AI/ML networking, which is directly driven and we've seen both in those programs, networking comes in a couple different flavors. The 48 volt is really driven by some of the AI/ML applications and we've certainly seen an uptick in that.
