====

3. Celestica's capital expenditure plans, including the construction of additional capacity in Thailand and Malaysia, signal the company's anticipation of continued demand strength through 2024 and into 2025.

The significance of Celestica's capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue is an indicator of the company's investment in its operational capabilities and future growth. An increase in capital expenditures suggests that the company is investing more heavily in expanding its capacity, upgrading technology, or entering new markets. Here are three possible interpretations of the expected increase in Celestica's capital expenditures:

1. **Expansion of Capacity**: The expected increase in capital expenditures to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues indicates that Celestica is expanding its capacity. This is evidenced by the construction of over 100,000 square feet of additional capacity in Thailand and more than 80,000 square feet in Malaysia to support demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs. This expansion suggests that Celestica is preparing for anticipated growth in demand from its customers, particularly in the areas of data center products and services for hyperscaler clients.
   ====
2. **Investment in Advanced Technologies**: The capital expenditure increase also signifies Celestica's commitment to investing in advanced technologies. The company is building out facilities that are highly automated, such as the AI/ML testing facility in Thailand, which is expected to enhance productivity and support the company's growth in complex product segments. This aligns with the company's strategic focus on high-growth areas like AI/ML compute capacity, indicating that Celestica is positioning itself to remain competitive in these advanced technology markets.
   ====
3. **Strategic Co-Investments with Customers**: The capital expenditure increase reflects strategic co-investments with key customers, such as the co-investment with a hyperscaler customer in Thailand. This collaborative approach to facility expansion demonstrates Celestica's strong customer relationships and its role as a strategic partner in supporting its customers' growth plans. It also suggests that Celestica is securing its position as a preferred supplier for future projects, which could lead to sustained revenue growth and stronger customer loyalty.

The significance of Celestica's capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue is an indicator of the company's investment in its operational capabilities and future growth. Capital expenditures represent the money the company spends to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment. A higher percentage suggests that the company is investing more relative to its revenue, which could be indicative of expansion efforts, technological upgrades, or increased production capacity.

====

The expected increase in capital expenditures indicates that Celestica is planning to expand its capacity and capabilities, particularly in areas that are experiencing strong demand. For instance, the company is gearing up for capacity expansions at key sites to support demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs. This suggests that Celestica is anticipating continued growth in these areas and is investing to ensure it can meet customer demand.

====

The increase in capital expenditures to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues, with a higher level of spend in the first half of the year, signals that Celestica is proactively investing in its infrastructure to support anticipated growth. The specific mention of building out over 100,000 square feet of additional capacity in Thailand and more than 80,000 square feet in Malaysia to support strong demand from customers in the CCS segment, including HPS business, indicates a strategic plan to enhance production capabilities in response to customer needs and market opportunities.

The significance of Celestica's capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue is an indicator of the company's investment in its operational capabilities and future growth. Capital expenditures represent the money the company spends to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment. A higher percentage suggests that the company is investing more relative to its revenue, which could be indicative of expansion efforts, technological upgrades, or increased production capacity.

====

The expected increase in capital expenditures indicates that Celestica is planning to expand its capacity and capabilities, particularly in areas that are experiencing strong demand. For instance, the company is gearing up for capacity expansions at key sites to support demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs. This suggests that Celestica is anticipating continued growth in these areas and is investing to ensure it can meet customer demand.

====

The increase in capital expenditures to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues, with a higher level of spend in the first half of the year, signals that Celestica is proactively investing in its future. The specific mention of building out over 100,000 square feet of additional capacity in Thailand and more than 80,000 square feet in Malaysia to support strong demand from customers in the CCS segment, including HPS business, indicates a strategic focus on scaling up operations to capitalize on emerging market opportunities.

The significance of Celestica's capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue is an indicator of the company's investment in its operational capabilities and future growth. An increase in capital expenditures suggests that the company is investing more heavily in expanding its capacity, upgrading technology, or entering new markets. Here are three possible interpretations of the expected increase in Celestica's capital expenditures:

====

1. The expected increase in capital expenditures to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues indicates that Celestica is planning to expand its capacity and capabilities, particularly in areas that are experiencing strong demand, such as AI/ML compute and HPS programs. This investment is likely aimed at supporting sustained growth and maintaining a competitive edge in these high-growth areas.

====

2. The increase in capital expenditures reflects Celestica's strategic plans to build out additional capacity at key sites, such as the expansion in Thailand and Malaysia. This is in response to customer demand and co-investment with a hyperscaler customer, suggesting a focus on long-term partnerships and the ability to meet the evolving needs of significant clients in the data center and cloud services space.

====

3. Celestica's capital expenditure plans, including the construction of new facilities and expansion of existing ones, signal a proactive approach to scaling operations in anticipation of continued demand from its customer base, particularly hyperscalers. This forward-looking investment strategy is indicative of management's confidence in the company's growth trajectory and commitment to meeting future demand.

The significance of Celestica's capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue is an indicator of the company's investment in its own growth and operational capacity. An increase in capital expenditures suggests that the company is investing more heavily in its infrastructure, which could be for expanding production capabilities, upgrading technology, or entering new markets. In the context of Celestica, the expected increase in capital expenditures indicates that the company is planning to expand its capacity to meet growing demand, particularly from its hyperscaler customers for AI/ML compute and HPS programs. This is evidenced by the construction of additional capacity in Thailand and Malaysia, with phases expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2024 and the first half of 2025, respectively. These expansions are partially funded by co-investment with a hyperscaler customer, which underscores the strategic nature of these investments in supporting long-term customer relationships and demand.

====
The expected increase in Celestica's capital expenditures to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues for 2024, up from 1.6% in the previous year, indicates that the company is preparing for future growth and demand. This is particularly relevant as the company is building out significant additional capacity in Thailand and Malaysia to support demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs. The capital expenditure is not only a sign of growth but also of the company's commitment to maintaining a competitive edge by investing in the necessary infrastructure to support its customers' evolving needs, especially in the data center and hyperscaler markets.

====
Celestica's planned increase in capital expenditures reflects its strategic focus on scaling up operations to support anticipated demand from its key growth areas, such as AI/ML compute and HPS programs. The capital expenditure increase is a proactive measure to ensure that Celestica has the capacity to meet customer demand, particularly from its hyperscaler customers. This investment in capacity expansions at key sites demonstrates Celestica's commitment to its growth strategy and its confidence in the continued demand from its customers. The capital investments are expected to enhance the company's operational capabilities and position it to capitalize on market opportunities in the coming years.

2024-02-07 19:49:58,493 INFO: 
The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:9>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] As we look to 2024, we expect our capital expenditures to modestly increase to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues, with a higher level of spend in the first half of the year. Our increasing level of capital expenditures is geared towards capacity expansions at key sites in support of demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs.
---

<Reference ID:11>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] During the fourth quarter and for 2023, we had one customer, which accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, representing 29% for the quarter and 22% for the year. Celestica has a long standing relationship with this customer, a global hyperscaler that we have been supporting for well over a decade. We support this customer across 25 programs covering HPS and non-HPS products in the areas of networking and compute.
---

<Reference ID:69>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Yeah. And the customers in terms of their cycles to get that upgraded a little bit longer than the quarter-to-quarter discussions is, I mean it's obviously going to be demand dependent, but is that a two-year process or five-year process what's the mindset towards getting that upgrade complete? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] My sense is, it's a multi-year process. It's certainly five plus years. And again, across each of the hyperscalers that we're dealing with, each has different appetites and different phases for deployment so that they won't necessarily all overlap at once, which for at least for Celestica should give us many years of growth. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. I would add to that Todd. Again we support the top five hyperscalers, but not all the top five hyperscalers spend CapEx the same way and there's a couple in particular that sometimes are leading with the more complex technologies, and then the other hyperscalers sometimes follow. What we're really encouraged about is, where we're seeing a lot of our new winds come in and our demand outlook is with some of the hyperscalers that are at the leading edge of the more complex technologies. Hence, we're seeing the demand strengthen AI/ML computes, and we're seeing the wins come in on the 800G switches, some of which are starting to be shipped in ‘24, and then a lot more which will be shipped in 2025. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And as we see some of the other hyperscalers that follow behind that, it gives demands, it gives us an idea of the fact that this does have an opportunity to be a multi-year opportunity for us. And so when we -- and to Rob's point, we're really in the early stages right now of the AI/ML CapEx investment cycle. Of course nobody has visibility 10 years out on what things are going to look like, but we are seeing demand signals at least for the next two or three years. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And I would just close with, the adoption of some custom silicon is going to drive compute programs, and that's going to accelerate in the future. And then investments in AI is also going to drive advanced networking and that's going to be a driver in the future. And then also with our enterprise customers, we expect to see the Internet traffic is going to drive improvements in data center interconnect as well. So this whole upgrade cycle I think has a long life to it.---

<Reference ID:64>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.
---

<Reference ID:47>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Now turning to our CCS segment. The demand backdrop for our CCS segment continues to be very strong. Investments from hyperscalers and data center infrastructure are fueling significant CapEx spending, driven by growing demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. In 2023, our portfolio with our hyperscalers saw revenue growth of 32% compared to 2022, recording nearly $2.9 billion in revenues. This accounted for 62% of our total CCS segment revenues in 2023, up from 51% the prior year.
---

<Reference ID:39>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] At our recent Virtual Investor meeting in November, we delved further into this dynamic, which we believe is long-term and structural in nature. We anticipate this solid growth to continue in 2024 and believe that this investment cycle has the potential to support several years of strong demand for our CCS segment. The demand outlook for our enterprise and market continues to be impressive as the beneficiary of hyperscaler's growing deployment of AI/ML compute capacity.
---

<Reference ID:17>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] In Thailand, we are currently building out over 100,000 square feet of additional capacity, with the first phase expected to be online in the first quarter of 2024, and the second phase expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. This expansion is being partially funded by a co-investment with one of our hyperscaler customers to facilitate demand for highly specialized data center products.
---

<Reference ID:10>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Capital expenditures for the quarter were $33 million or approximately 1.5% of revenue, compared with 1.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, capital expenditures were $125 million or 1.6% of revenue as we continue to invest in growth across our network to support customer demand.
---

<Reference ID:59>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Pro CCS, okay. Perfect. And then the capacity adds in Thailand and Malaysia. Rob, could you give us a ballpark in terms of the revenue production capacity in each of those or combined? And is that incremental revenue where there are basically new programs or new capacity versus shifting from another region? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Look, what I can tell you, Matt is, how much square foot we're adding and that the capacity improvements are a couple of folds. One, phase 1, if you will, which is coming online this quarter is about 28,000 square feet of manufacturing space. It's really a AI/ML testing facility. So it's a test farm -- for fully automated test farm for all AI/ML products. So that's coming online right about now. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And then phase 2 will be the first half of 2025 and that's a combined productivity play of where we're combining all our warehousing in Thailand into one facility to save on space and drive productivity and also adding about 156,000 I mean 130,000 of plus of manufacturing space, which is going to support existing and new customers as well largely around AI/ML. And we think those capacity expansions should take care of us through the next couple of years of growth.
---

<Reference ID:13>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Finally, in our enterprise end market, we expect revenue to be up in the high-60s percentage range year-over-year, driven by anticipated demand growth in AI/ML compute programs from our hyperscaler customers.
---

<Reference ID:52>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] We're seeing the strong momentum from 2023 continue, and as mentioned earlier, we anticipate significant growth within our AI/ML compute portfolio as we enter 2024. We expect additional growth in our storage business to materialize in the latter half of the year, driven by demand from new programs. After experiencing some softness in 2023, demand in our communications end market is anticipated to resume year-to-year growth in the first quarter, driven by a resumption of strength in networking demand from hyperscalers, which is expected to persist throughout the year.
---

<Reference ID:7>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And in Malaysia, we are building more than 80,000 square feet of capacity to support strong demand from customers in our CCS segment, including our HPS business. This edition is expected to be online in the first half of 2024.

<Reference ID:68>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Hi. Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I want to step back from these detailed questions and just ask a question on the hyperscaler market, data -- the global data center market. What's your view on how much of the data center hyperscaler market has been upgraded to support generative AI and large language model processing needs? How far into that cycle would you think we are at this point? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Good morning, Todd. That's a very good question. I would say, we're still in the early innings of the upgrade cycle. I mean, and I say that by the fact that it just started about a year or so ago, and given the amount of compute, which makes up about 50% of any data center that needs to kind of get upgraded, I think we're still in the very early innings of that upgrade cycle.
---

<Reference ID:32>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] The products we build are highly complex, and as a result, the majority of these programs are single sourced. In addition, we are pleased that as a result of our strength in engineering and solid operational execution, we continue to win new programs with this customer and expect to see demand strength continue through 2024 and into 2025.

<Reference ID:3>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] Good morning and thank you for joining us on Celestica’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Rob Mionis, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mandeep Chawla, Chief Financial Officer.
---

<Reference ID:15>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] I'll now turn the call back over to Rob to discuss the outlook for each of our end markets and the overall business.

The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:6>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] We refer you to yesterday’s press release and our Q4 2023 earnings presentation, which are available at celestica.com under the Investor Relations tab, for more information about these and certain other non-IFRS financial measures, including a reconciliation of historical non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures from our financial statements and a description of recent modifications to specified non-IFRS financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, all references to dollars on this call are to U.S. dollars and per share information is based on diluted shares outstanding.
---

<Reference ID:9>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] As we look to 2024, we expect our capital expenditures to modestly increase to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues, with a higher level of spend in the first half of the year. Our increasing level of capital expenditures is geared towards capacity expansions at key sites in support of demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs.
---

<Reference ID:10>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Capital expenditures for the quarter were $33 million or approximately 1.5% of revenue, compared with 1.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, capital expenditures were $125 million or 1.6% of revenue as we continue to invest in growth across our network to support customer demand.
---

<Reference ID:3>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] Good morning and thank you for joining us on Celestica’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Rob Mionis, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mandeep Chawla, Chief Financial Officer.
---

<Reference ID:11>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] During the fourth quarter and for 2023, we had one customer, which accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, representing 29% for the quarter and 22% for the year. Celestica has a long standing relationship with this customer, a global hyperscaler that we have been supporting for well over a decade. We support this customer across 25 programs covering HPS and non-HPS products in the areas of networking and compute.
---

<Reference ID:69>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Yeah. And the customers in terms of their cycles to get that upgraded a little bit longer than the quarter-to-quarter discussions is, I mean it's obviously going to be demand dependent, but is that a two-year process or five-year process what's the mindset towards getting that upgrade complete? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] My sense is, it's a multi-year process. It's certainly five plus years. And again, across each of the hyperscalers that we're dealing with, each has different appetites and different phases for deployment so that they won't necessarily all overlap at once, which for at least for Celestica should give us many years of growth. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. I would add to that Todd. Again we support the top five hyperscalers, but not all the top five hyperscalers spend CapEx the same way and there's a couple in particular that sometimes are leading with the more complex technologies, and then the other hyperscalers sometimes follow. What we're really encouraged about is, where we're seeing a lot of our new winds come in and our demand outlook is with some of the hyperscalers that are at the leading edge of the more complex technologies. Hence, we're seeing the demand strengthen AI/ML computes, and we're seeing the wins come in on the 800G switches, some of which are starting to be shipped in ‘24, and then a lot more which will be shipped in 2025. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And as we see some of the other hyperscalers that follow behind that, it gives demands, it gives us an idea of the fact that this does have an opportunity to be a multi-year opportunity for us. And so when we -- and to Rob's point, we're really in the early stages right now of the AI/ML CapEx investment cycle. Of course nobody has visibility 10 years out on what things are going to look like, but we are seeing demand signals at least for the next two or three years. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And I would just close with, the adoption of some custom silicon is going to drive compute programs, and that's going to accelerate in the future. And then investments in AI is also going to drive advanced networking and that's going to be a driver in the future. And then also with our enterprise customers, we expect to see the Internet traffic is going to drive improvements in data center interconnect as well. So this whole upgrade cycle I think has a long life to it.---

<Reference ID:47>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Now turning to our CCS segment. The demand backdrop for our CCS segment continues to be very strong. Investments from hyperscalers and data center infrastructure are fueling significant CapEx spending, driven by growing demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. In 2023, our portfolio with our hyperscalers saw revenue growth of 32% compared to 2022, recording nearly $2.9 billion in revenues. This accounted for 62% of our total CCS segment revenues in 2023, up from 51% the prior year.
---

<Reference ID:64>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.
---

<Reference ID:45>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In our capital equipment business, market forecasts continue to suggest that the underlying market demand is operating close to trough levels, and we should see flat to slightly higher demand in 2024. We are maintaining our outlook for modest revenue growth in our capital equipment business in 2024, supported by the ramping of new program wins and our assumption of base demand holding flag for 2023. We anticipate that the year-to-year growth will largely be in the back half of the year, setting up for a stronger recovery and demand in 2025.
---

<Reference ID:65>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Okay. Thank you. Yeah. And then the second question, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. You said you're going to revisit the full year outlook, I think in Q1, but the outlook for 5.5% to 6% operating margin seems conservative given, you're doing so well in the enterprise business in CCS at 6.7% and you're entering at 6% and the guide looks like 6%. So it looks as though it's going to decelerate in the back half of the year. Maybe if you could discuss that and I'll pass on. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Yeah, Rob. I'll talk about two things. one is the outlook for the full year and then I can talk to your point on margin specifically. So, when we look at full year 2024, we're really pleased with the way we ended ‘23. And clearly, we're off to a really hot start now into the first quarter. And again, encouraged by where we're seeing the demand signals come through, both on comms and HPS, but also the demand signals from the hyperscalers continue to strengthen. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] As you know, in November, we provided the outlook of $8.5 billion or more and $2.70 of EPS or more. And right now, we really do see that as being the floor. What we are looking to do, as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks is, we're going back out to the customer base and revalidating the second half outlook. We're seeing that increased strength happening in the first half and now what we want to do is go and validate whether or not those increasing level of demand signals are going to be added to the second half as well. And so, in April, we'll come back with an updated forecast. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] To your point on the margin profile itself, as we talked about, ATS is expected to see some very minor levels of declines in the first half of this year before resuming growth in the back end of the year. ATS, again, we're expecting across all of our end markets to have some level of growth in 2024. But because that growth in the back half is going to be off the back of ramping programs, there is going to be a little bit of margin challenges around there as well. Again, 6% for the first quarter, I believe the 270 is the floor. And obviously, we're going to be working towards the high end of that 5.5% to 6% range as best we can. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] And one other thing, I would add, Rob, I think by the end of the first quarter we'll have better visibility into capital equipment markets. We are seeing some signs of recovery. We're cautiously optimistic. Some of our customers are starting to restock consumables and spares, which is a good sign. So I think as capital equipment gets better, so will some of the ATS margins as well.
---

<Reference ID:59>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Pro CCS, okay. Perfect. And then the capacity adds in Thailand and Malaysia. Rob, could you give us a ballpark in terms of the revenue production capacity in each of those or combined? And is that incremental revenue where there are basically new programs or new capacity versus shifting from another region? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Look, what I can tell you, Matt is, how much square foot we're adding and that the capacity improvements are a couple of folds. One, phase 1, if you will, which is coming online this quarter is about 28,000 square feet of manufacturing space. It's really a AI/ML testing facility. So it's a test farm -- for fully automated test farm for all AI/ML products. So that's coming online right about now. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And then phase 2 will be the first half of 2025 and that's a combined productivity play of where we're combining all our warehousing in Thailand into one facility to save on space and drive productivity and also adding about 156,000 I mean 130,000 of plus of manufacturing space, which is going to support existing and new customers as well largely around AI/ML. And we think those capacity expansions should take care of us through the next couple of years of growth.
---

<Reference ID:39>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] At our recent Virtual Investor meeting in November, we delved further into this dynamic, which we believe is long-term and structural in nature. We anticipate this solid growth to continue in 2024 and believe that this investment cycle has the potential to support several years of strong demand for our CCS segment. The demand outlook for our enterprise and market continues to be impressive as the beneficiary of hyperscaler's growing deployment of AI/ML compute capacity.
---

<Reference ID:13>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Finally, in our enterprise end market, we expect revenue to be up in the high-60s percentage range year-over-year, driven by anticipated demand growth in AI/ML compute programs from our hyperscaler customers.
---

<Reference ID:7>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And in Malaysia, we are building more than 80,000 square feet of capacity to support strong demand from customers in our CCS segment, including our HPS business. This edition is expected to be online in the first half of 2024.
---

<Reference ID:53>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Within our HPS business, we anticipate to resume year-to-year growth in the first quarter of 2024 and for the full year. This growth is being fueled by a number of new program loans in both networking, supported by growth in our 400G and 800G platforms, and to some extent AI/ML compute. For 2024, we are maintaining our previously communicated expectation of low-double digit percentage revenue growth in our CCS segment, supported by solid growth in both our enterprise and communications end markets.
---

<Reference ID:17>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] In Thailand, we are currently building out over 100,000 square feet of additional capacity, with the first phase expected to be online in the first quarter of 2024, and the second phase expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. This expansion is being partially funded by a co-investment with one of our hyperscaler customers to facilitate demand for highly specialized data center products.
---

<Reference ID:55>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] Appreciate it. Thanks for that. And the final question, you also mentioned the ramp up of some of these sites. Just wondering whether you have enough capacity to deal with the near-term demand that's coming in throughout this year and how those discussions are going on your ability to service some of that demand? Thank you. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Yeah. Thanks. We've been interlocking with our customers and been investing forward on capacity expansions, mainly in Thailand. We have a couple of phases, and also in Malaysia, a phase is coming online in February, we've been cutting, frankly. So yes, we do have enough capacity, and it's coming online, very much aligned with the demand state, I would say. And these are also highly automated factories, highly automated test centers, so they're really producing a lot of productivity.

2024-02-07 19:55:37,439 INFO: 
The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:69>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Yeah. And the customers in terms of their cycles to get that upgraded a little bit longer than the quarter-to-quarter discussions is, I mean it's obviously going to be demand dependent, but is that a two-year process or five-year process what's the mindset towards getting that upgrade complete? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] My sense is, it's a multi-year process. It's certainly five plus years. And again, across each of the hyperscalers that we're dealing with, each has different appetites and different phases for deployment so that they won't necessarily all overlap at once, which for at least for Celestica should give us many years of growth. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. I would add to that Todd. Again we support the top five hyperscalers, but not all the top five hyperscalers spend CapEx the same way and there's a couple in particular that sometimes are leading with the more complex technologies, and then the other hyperscalers sometimes follow. What we're really encouraged about is, where we're seeing a lot of our new winds come in and our demand outlook is with some of the hyperscalers that are at the leading edge of the more complex technologies. Hence, we're seeing the demand strengthen AI/ML computes, and we're seeing the wins come in on the 800G switches, some of which are starting to be shipped in ‘24, and then a lot more which will be shipped in 2025. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And as we see some of the other hyperscalers that follow behind that, it gives demands, it gives us an idea of the fact that this does have an opportunity to be a multi-year opportunity for us. And so when we -- and to Rob's point, we're really in the early stages right now of the AI/ML CapEx investment cycle. Of course nobody has visibility 10 years out on what things are going to look like, but we are seeing demand signals at least for the next two or three years. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And I would just close with, the adoption of some custom silicon is going to drive compute programs, and that's going to accelerate in the future. And then investments in AI is also going to drive advanced networking and that's going to be a driver in the future. And then also with our enterprise customers, we expect to see the Internet traffic is going to drive improvements in data center interconnect as well. So this whole upgrade cycle I think has a long life to it.---

<Reference ID:64>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.

<Reference ID:65>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Okay. Thank you. Yeah. And then the second question, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. You said you're going to revisit the full year outlook, I think in Q1, but the outlook for 5.5% to 6% operating margin seems conservative given, you're doing so well in the enterprise business in CCS at 6.7% and you're entering at 6% and the guide looks like 6%. So it looks as though it's going to decelerate in the back half of the year. Maybe if you could discuss that and I'll pass on. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Yeah, Rob. I'll talk about two things. one is the outlook for the full year and then I can talk to your point on margin specifically. So, when we look at full year 2024, we're really pleased with the way we ended ‘23. And clearly, we're off to a really hot start now into the first quarter. And again, encouraged by where we're seeing the demand signals come through, both on comms and HPS, but also the demand signals from the hyperscalers continue to strengthen. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] As you know, in November, we provided the outlook of $8.5 billion or more and $2.70 of EPS or more. And right now, we really do see that as being the floor. What we are looking to do, as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks is, we're going back out to the customer base and revalidating the second half outlook. We're seeing that increased strength happening in the first half and now what we want to do is go and validate whether or not those increasing level of demand signals are going to be added to the second half as well. And so, in April, we'll come back with an updated forecast. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] To your point on the margin profile itself, as we talked about, ATS is expected to see some very minor levels of declines in the first half of this year before resuming growth in the back end of the year. ATS, again, we're expecting across all of our end markets to have some level of growth in 2024. But because that growth in the back half is going to be off the back of ramping programs, there is going to be a little bit of margin challenges around there as well. Again, 6% for the first quarter, I believe the 270 is the floor. And obviously, we're going to be working towards the high end of that 5.5% to 6% range as best we can. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] And one other thing, I would add, Rob, I think by the end of the first quarter we'll have better visibility into capital equipment markets. We are seeing some signs of recovery. We're cautiously optimistic. Some of our customers are starting to restock consumables and spares, which is a good sign. So I think as capital equipment gets better, so will some of the ATS margins as well.

<Reference ID:59>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Pro CCS, okay. Perfect. And then the capacity adds in Thailand and Malaysia. Rob, could you give us a ballpark in terms of the revenue production capacity in each of those or combined? And is that incremental revenue where there are basically new programs or new capacity versus shifting from another region? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Look, what I can tell you, Matt is, how much square foot we're adding and that the capacity improvements are a couple of folds. One, phase 1, if you will, which is coming online this quarter is about 28,000 square feet of manufacturing space. It's really a AI/ML testing facility. So it's a test farm -- for fully automated test farm for all AI/ML products. So that's coming online right about now. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And then phase 2 will be the first half of 2025 and that's a combined productivity play of where we're combining all our warehousing in Thailand into one facility to save on space and drive productivity and also adding about 156,000 I mean 130,000 of plus of manufacturing space, which is going to support existing and new customers as well largely around AI/ML. And we think those capacity expansions should take care of us through the next couple of years of growth.

<Reference ID:55>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] Appreciate it. Thanks for that. And the final question, you also mentioned the ramp up of some of these sites. Just wondering whether you have enough capacity to deal with the near-term demand that's coming in throughout this year and how those discussions are going on your ability to service some of that demand? Thank you. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Yeah. Thanks. We've been interlocking with our customers and been investing forward on capacity expansions, mainly in Thailand. We have a couple of phases, and also in Malaysia, a phase is coming online in February, we've been cutting, frankly. So yes, we do have enough capacity, and it's coming online, very much aligned with the demand state, I would say. And these are also highly automated factories, highly automated test centers, so they're really producing a lot of productivity.

---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Hi. Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I want to step back from these detailed questions and just ask a question on the hyperscaler market, data -- the global data center market. What's your view on how much of the data center hyperscaler market has been upgraded to support generative AI and large language model processing needs? How far into that cycle would you think we are at this point? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Good morning, Todd. That's a very good question. I would say, we're still in the early innings of the upgrade cycle. I mean, and I say that by the fact that it just started about a year or so ago, and given the amount of compute, which makes up about 50% of any data center that needs to kind of get upgraded, I think we're still in the very early innings of that upgrade cycle.

---Extract: (Q&A)[Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Hi. Good morning. With respect to the full year guidance, I hear you with respect to wanting to discuss the second half outlook with your customers before revisiting the guidance. But certainly from the demand signals, you're highlighting it seems like it'll be a stronger second half. I guess from your perspective, what might be the key areas of uncertainty you want to further color on before visiting guidance? Would that be on semi and industrial, or which areas would be the biggest source of demand variability as you think about second half? (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Yeah. Hi, Thanos. Mandeep here. So we were pleased to be able to interlock with our customer base, specifically on the hyperscaler side in the fourth quarter, and that has led us to confidently come out with the outlook that we did. Even after our virtual investor meeting in November, we saw incremental improvement to the forecast coming from the hyperscalers, and so that's reflected in our Q1 guidance. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Again, our outlook is for 14% year-over-year growth, which is higher than what we would have said probably in November. And we're seeing that demand strength continue into the second quarter. So the conversations with the hyperscalers are, is there an improvement in material availability on your end? Is there -- has your deployment change -- plans changed at all? And how does that impact the second half of the year? Is it going to be similar to what we're seeing right now in the first half of the year?

Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.

The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:66>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Hi. Good morning. With respect to the full year guidance, I hear you with respect to wanting to discuss the second half outlook with your customers before revisiting the guidance. But certainly from the demand signals, you're highlighting it seems like it'll be a stronger second half. I guess from your perspective, what might be the key areas of uncertainty you want to further color on before visiting guidance? Would that be on semi and industrial, or which areas would be the biggest source of demand variability as you think about second half? (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Yeah. Hi, Thanos. Mandeep here. So we were pleased to be able to interlock with our customer base, specifically on the hyperscaler side in the fourth quarter, and that has led us to confidently come out with the outlook that we did. Even after our virtual investor meeting in November, we saw incremental improvement to the forecast coming from the hyperscalers, and so that's reflected in our Q1 guidance. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Again, our outlook is for 14% year-over-year growth, which is higher than what we would have said probably in November. And we're seeing that demand strength continue into the second quarter. So the conversations with the hyperscalers are, is there an improvement in material availability on your end? Is there -- has your deployment change -- plans changed at all? And how does that impact the second half of the year? Is it going to be similar to what we're seeing right now in the first half of the year?

<Reference ID:68>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Hi. Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I want to step back from these detailed questions and just ask a question on the hyperscaler market, data -- the global data center market. What's your view on how much of the data center hyperscaler market has been upgraded to support generative AI and large language model processing needs? How far into that cycle would you think we are at this point? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Good morning, Todd. That's a very good question. I would say, we're still in the early innings of the upgrade cycle. I mean, and I say that by the fact that it just started about a year or so ago, and given the amount of compute, which makes up about 50% of any data center that needs to kind of get upgraded, I think we're still in the very early innings of that upgrade cycle.

<Reference ID:57>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] And so based on that, would you expect the Q2 to be up sequentially then again? (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] On a revenue basis, yes. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yes. We would expect higher revenues in Q2 than we do in Q1.

<Reference ID:64>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.

<Reference ID:56>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] Hi. Good morning. Congrats on a strong quarter here. So communications was stronger than expected this quarter, was that driven by AI demand strength or was that from non-AI related cloud demand where we're also starting to see some early signs of recovery? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In terms of comms, it was driven by networking, which is kind of the pull through that we've been mentioning that we would see as a result of AI/ML demand. And within networking, there's, I'll call it, AI/ML networking, which is directly driven and we've seen both in those programs, networking comes in a couple different flavors. The 48 volt is really driven by some of the AI/ML applications and we've certainly seen an uptick in that.

---Extract: (Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Pro CCS, okay. Perfect. And then the capacity adds in Thailand and Malaysia. Rob, could you give us a ballpark in terms of the revenue production capacity in each of those or combined? And is that incremental revenue where there are basically new programs or new capacity versus shifting from another region? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Look, what I can tell you, Matt is, how much square foot we're adding and that the capacity improvements are a couple of folds. One, phase 1, if you will, which is coming online this quarter is about 28,000 square feet of manufacturing space. It's really a AI/ML testing facility. So it's a test farm -- for fully automated test farm for all AI/ML products. So that's coming online right about now. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And then phase 2 will be the first half of 2025 and that's a combined productivity play of where we're combining all our warehousing in Thailand into one facility to save on space and drive productivity and also adding about 156,000 I mean 130,000 of plus of manufacturing space, which is going to support existing and new customers as well largely around AI/ML. And we think those capacity expansions should take care of us through the next couple of years of growth.

---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter revenue came in at $2.14 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Revenue was up 5% year-over-year, supported by solid growth in our CCS segment, partially offset by a modest decline in our ATS segment.

<Reference ID:26>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Now turning to our guidance for the first quarter of 2024. First quarter revenues are expected to be in the range of $2.025 billion to $2.175 billion, which, if the midpoint of this range is achieved, would represent growth of 14% compared to the prior year period. First quarter non-IFRS adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.77 per share, which at the midpoint would represent an improvement of $0.25 per share or 53% compared to the first quarter of 2023. If the midpoint of our revenue and non-IFRS adjusted EPS guidance ranges are achieved, non-IFRS operating margin would be 6.0%, which would represent an increase of 80 basis points over the same period last year.

---Extract: (Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] Hi. Good morning. Congrats on a strong quarter here. So communications was stronger than expected this quarter, was that driven by AI demand strength or was that from non-AI related cloud demand where we're also starting to see some early signs of recovery? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In terms of comms, it was driven by networking, which is kind of the pull through that we've been mentioning that we would see as a result of AI/ML demand. And within networking, there's, I'll call it, AI/ML networking, which is directly driven and we've seen both in those programs, networking comes in a couple different flavors. The 48 volt is really driven by some of the AI/ML applications and we've certainly seen an uptick in that.

---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Thank you, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. We ended the year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving revenue of $2.14 billion, which is towards the high-end of our guidance range, while our non-IFRS adjusted EPS came in at $0.76, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our non-IFRS operating margin was 6% exceeding the midpoint of our revenue and non-IFRS adjusted EPS guidance ranges.

---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.

The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:19>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Moving on to some additional key metrics. At the end of the fourth quarter, our cash balance was $370 million, higher by $17 million sequentially. In combination with our approximately $600 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver, this provides us with liquidity of approximately $1 billion, which we believe is sufficient to meet our anticipated business needs.

<Reference ID:3>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] Good morning and thank you for joining us on Celestica’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Rob Mionis, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mandeep Chawla, Chief Financial Officer.
---

<Reference ID:11>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] During the fourth quarter and for 2023, we had one customer, which accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, representing 29% for the quarter and 22% for the year. Celestica has a long standing relationship with this customer, a global hyperscaler that we have been supporting for well over a decade. We support this customer across 25 programs covering HPS and non-HPS products in the areas of networking and compute.
---

<Reference ID:6>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] We refer you to yesterday’s press release and our Q4 2023 earnings presentation, which are available at celestica.com under the Investor Relations tab, for more information about these and certain other non-IFRS financial measures, including a reconciliation of historical non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures from our financial statements and a description of recent modifications to specified non-IFRS financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, all references to dollars on this call are to U.S. dollars and per share information is based on diluted shares outstanding.
---

<Reference ID:53>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Within our HPS business, we anticipate to resume year-to-year growth in the first quarter of 2024 and for the full year. This growth is being fueled by a number of new program loans in both networking, supported by growth in our 400G and 800G platforms, and to some extent AI/ML compute. For 2024, we are maintaining our previously communicated expectation of low-double digit percentage revenue growth in our CCS segment, supported by solid growth in both our enterprise and communications end markets.
---

<Reference ID:69>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Yeah. And the customers in terms of their cycles to get that upgraded a little bit longer than the quarter-to-quarter discussions is, I mean it's obviously going to be demand dependent, but is that a two-year process or five-year process what's the mindset towards getting that upgrade complete? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] My sense is, it's a multi-year process. It's certainly five plus years. And again, across each of the hyperscalers that we're dealing with, each has different appetites and different phases for deployment so that they won't necessarily all overlap at once, which for at least for Celestica should give us many years of growth. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. I would add to that Todd. Again we support the top five hyperscalers, but not all the top five hyperscalers spend CapEx the same way and there's a couple in particular that sometimes are leading with the more complex technologies, and then the other hyperscalers sometimes follow. What we're really encouraged about is, where we're seeing a lot of our new winds come in and our demand outlook is with some of the hyperscalers that are at the leading edge of the more complex technologies. Hence, we're seeing the demand strengthen AI/ML computes, and we're seeing the wins come in on the 800G switches, some of which are starting to be shipped in ‘24, and then a lot more which will be shipped in 2025. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And as we see some of the other hyperscalers that follow behind that, it gives demands, it gives us an idea of the fact that this does have an opportunity to be a multi-year opportunity for us. And so when we -- and to Rob's point, we're really in the early stages right now of the AI/ML CapEx investment cycle. Of course nobody has visibility 10 years out on what things are going to look like, but we are seeing demand signals at least for the next two or three years. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And I would just close with, the adoption of some custom silicon is going to drive compute programs, and that's going to accelerate in the future. And then investments in AI is also going to drive advanced networking and that's going to be a driver in the future. And then also with our enterprise customers, we expect to see the Internet traffic is going to drive improvements in data center interconnect as well. So this whole upgrade cycle I think has a long life to it.---

<Reference ID:9>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] As we look to 2024, we expect our capital expenditures to modestly increase to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues, with a higher level of spend in the first half of the year. Our increasing level of capital expenditures is geared towards capacity expansions at key sites in support of demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs.

(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship.

<Reference ID:39>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] At our recent Virtual Investor meeting in November, we delved further into this dynamic, which we believe is long-term and structural in nature. We anticipate this solid growth to continue in 2024 and believe that this investment cycle has the potential to support several years of strong demand for our CCS segment. The demand outlook for our enterprise and market continues to be impressive as the beneficiary of hyperscaler's growing deployment of AI/ML compute capacity.

<Reference ID:7>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And in Malaysia, we are building more than 80,000 square feet of capacity to support strong demand from customers in our CCS segment, including our HPS business. This edition is expected to be online in the first half of 2024.
---

<Reference ID:34>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Turning to non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow. We generated $84 million in the fourth quarter compared to $43 million in the prior year period, marking our 20th consecutive quarter of positive non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow. This result brings our total free cash flow for the year to $194 million ahead of our full year outlook of $150 million and approximately double our results from 2022 of $94 million. The out performance was driven by strong profitability and working capital management.
---

<Reference ID:18>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Looking forward to 2024, we are expecting $200 million or more of non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow, $25 million higher than the outlook we shared in our November Virtual Investor meeting.
---

<Reference ID:41>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In addition, as Mandeep mentioned, we have raised our non-IFRS free cash flow outlook for the year to $200 million or more. We are pleased with our strong performance in 2023 and continue to see very positive momentum in the first quarter of 2024. As such, we are currently undertaking discussions with our customers and suppliers in order to obtain better visibility into the remainder of the year. And we look forward to providing an update on our 2024 outlook with our first quarter results.
---

<Reference ID:40>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In 2023, our business generated revenue of approximately $8 billion, 10% higher than 2022, driven by strong growth in both our CCS and ATS segments. Our non-IFRS adjusted EPS of $2.43 was up 28% versus the prior year, while non-IFRS operating margin of 5.6% was higher by 70 basis points, with both results marking the highest in the company's history. Our strong profitability and working capital management allowed us to generate non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow of $194 million, exceeding our full year target of $150 million.
---

<Reference ID:58>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Okay. And just lastly, Mandeep, you talked about you basically increased your cash flow guidance for the year while keeping everything else intact. What are the reasons for that? Is that a function of the inventory reduction and working capital reduction and the cash flows from that or anything else? (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. So we continue to be encouraged that the material environment is stabilizing and improving. We're seeing lead times right now, not necessarily at pre-pandemic levels for both passes (ph) and semis, but we are seeing them drop pretty close to that level and they've been improving quarter-to-quarter. We have been unwinding inventory as a result, so we're pleased that we're able to reduce some of that cash. Really strong finish 2023, $194 million, we believe that that is the right goal as a minimum for next year on the back of increasing profitability and an inventory environment that we think is going to continue to improve. And so we think the goal of $200 billion or more reflects a good level of conversion and is the right target at this time.
---

<Reference ID:26>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Now turning to our guidance for the first quarter of 2024. First quarter revenues are expected to be in the range of $2.025 billion to $2.175 billion, which, if the midpoint of this range is achieved, would represent growth of 14% compared to the prior year period. First quarter non-IFRS adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.77 per share, which at the midpoint would represent an improvement of $0.25 per share or 53% compared to the first quarter of 2023. If the midpoint of our revenue and non-IFRS adjusted EPS guidance ranges are achieved, non-IFRS operating margin would be 6.0%, which would represent an increase of 80 basis points over the same period last year.
---

<Reference ID:20>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Moving on to working capital. At the end of the fourth quarter, our inventory balance was $2.11 billion, down $155 million sequentially, and down $244 million year-over-year. Cash deposits were at $905 million at the end of the fourth quarter, up $30 million sequentially, and higher by $79 million compared to the prior year period.
---

<Reference ID:36>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] When accounting for cash deposits, inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was lower by $323 million on a year-over-year basis and lower by $185 million sequentially. Inventory days, net of cash deposit days were 62 in the fourth quarter compared to 79 in the prior year period. We are pleased with the improvements we are seeing in inventory as material constraints continue to improve and [indiscernible] lead times normalize. Cash cycle days were 72 during the fourth quarter, flat sequentially, and 8 days higher than the prior year period.
---

<Reference ID:10>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Capital expenditures for the quarter were $33 million or approximately 1.5% of revenue, compared with 1.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, capital expenditures were $125 million or 1.6% of revenue as we continue to invest in growth across our network to support customer demand.

<Reference ID:61>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] And just finally for me. Just to revisit, ATS, I think some of your peers have also been seeing a slowdown in their end markets over the last little bit based on customers working through their inventory buffers. Is that what you're seeing as well this quarter and can you maybe speak to within industrial and capital equipment end markets specifically, and what is causing you to expect demand to return by the second half? Is it primarily kind of those new program ramps? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] Yeah. Good question. So our industrial business in ‘23, a way of reminder, grew close to 30%. Again, it was fueled by green energy programs, including EV charging, energy storage, energy generation. As we were exiting the year, demand started cycling down in some of these markets and the markets that were really impacted were interest rate sensitive markets, but moreover, because the material environment has dramatically improved, our customers were taking the opportunity to reduce their strategic inventory buffers. We think those buffers will normalize in the first half of the year, and in the second half of the year, we have new programs, ramps planned, which would return the industrial business to growth. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] And our capital equipment business, as I mentioned earlier, we're cautiously optimistic as we get to the back half of the year and certainly into 2025 that we're seeing some signs of growth and the costs are pretty much aligned there. And again, we're seeing some spares orders. And as a reminder, some of the headwinds that we're seeing in ATS we think will be more than offset with our strength that we're seeing in our CCS business. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And then to Rob's point on capital equipment. So our assumption right now is that the base market is going to be flat. We're around trough levels right now, some encouraging signs as Rob talked about, and where we're expecting the growth to be in capital equipment is as we ramp AS/ML. AS/ML is a customer of ours for a few years now, but we've won a number of programs over the last year or so, and those programs are in the process of being ramped right now, and the demand signals from that specific customer have not changed. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And so what we're looking to do as we go to the rest of the customer base in capital equipment is to understand whether or not some of these early signs that we're seeing in terms of consumables and spares is going to lead to a demand uptick in the back end of the year. And so it's really around hyperscalers and capital equipment.

Celestica's liquidity position is robust, with a cash balance of $370 million at the end of the fourth quarter, which is an increase of $17 million sequentially. Additionally, the company has approximately $600 million of borrowing capacity under its revolver. Combined, this provides Celestica with liquidity of approximately $1 billion. This level of liquidity is believed to be sufficient to meet the company's anticipated business needs, supporting both operational requirements and strategic initiatives. <Reference ID:19>

One challenge in analyzing Celestica Inc.'s earnings call was understanding the impact of forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. This adds a layer of complexity to the analysis as it requires assessing the likelihood of various outcomes and their potential impact on the company's financial performance.

====

Another challenge was the use of various non-IFRS financial measures, such as adjusted EPS and non-IFRS operating margin. These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Analyzing these non-standard financial metrics requires a deep understanding of the adjustments made and how they relate to the company's overall financial health.

====

A third challenge was the need to reconcile historical non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures from the financial statements. This reconciliation process is crucial for understanding the differences between reported results and adjusted figures, which can provide insights into the underlying business performance but also adds complexity to the financial analysis.

The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:6>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] We refer you to yesterday’s press release and our Q4 2023 earnings presentation, which are available at celestica.com under the Investor Relations tab, for more information about these and certain other non-IFRS financial measures, including a reconciliation of historical non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures from our financial statements and a description of recent modifications to specified non-IFRS financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, all references to dollars on this call are to U.S. dollars and per share information is based on diluted shares outstanding.
---

<Reference ID:3>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] Good morning and thank you for joining us on Celestica’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Rob Mionis, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mandeep Chawla, Chief Financial Officer.
---

<Reference ID:1>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] As a reminder, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities laws. Such forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, forecasts and assumptions which are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from conclusions, forecasts or projections expressed in such statements.
---

<Reference ID:2>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] For identification and discussion of such factors and assumptions, as well as further information concerning forward-looking statements, please refer to yesterday’s press release, including the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements therein, our most recent annual report on Form 20-F and our other public filings, which can be accessed at sec.gov and sedarplus.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by law.

<Reference ID:11>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] During the fourth quarter and for 2023, we had one customer, which accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, representing 29% for the quarter and 22% for the year. Celestica has a long standing relationship with this customer, a global hyperscaler that we have been supporting for well over a decade. We support this customer across 25 programs covering HPS and non-HPS products in the areas of networking and compute.
---

<Reference ID:5>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] Listeners should be cautioned that references to any of the foregoing measures during this call denote non-IFRS financial measures whether or not specifically designated as such. These non-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies that report under IFRS or who report under U.S. GAAP and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe similar operating metrics.

<Reference ID:69>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Yeah. And the customers in terms of their cycles to get that upgraded a little bit longer than the quarter-to-quarter discussions is, I mean it's obviously going to be demand dependent, but is that a two-year process or five-year process what's the mindset towards getting that upgrade complete? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] My sense is, it's a multi-year process. It's certainly five plus years. And again, across each of the hyperscalers that we're dealing with, each has different appetites and different phases for deployment so that they won't necessarily all overlap at once, which for at least for Celestica should give us many years of growth. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. I would add to that Todd. Again we support the top five hyperscalers, but not all the top five hyperscalers spend CapEx the same way and there's a couple in particular that sometimes are leading with the more complex technologies, and then the other hyperscalers sometimes follow. What we're really encouraged about is, where we're seeing a lot of our new winds come in and our demand outlook is with some of the hyperscalers that are at the leading edge of the more complex technologies. Hence, we're seeing the demand strengthen AI/ML computes, and we're seeing the wins come in on the 800G switches, some of which are starting to be shipped in ‘24, and then a lot more which will be shipped in 2025. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And as we see some of the other hyperscalers that follow behind that, it gives demands, it gives us an idea of the fact that this does have an opportunity to be a multi-year opportunity for us. And so when we -- and to Rob's point, we're really in the early stages right now of the AI/ML CapEx investment cycle. Of course nobody has visibility 10 years out on what things are going to look like, but we are seeing demand signals at least for the next two or three years. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And I would just close with, the adoption of some custom silicon is going to drive compute programs, and that's going to accelerate in the future. And then investments in AI is also going to drive advanced networking and that's going to be a driver in the future. And then also with our enterprise customers, we expect to see the Internet traffic is going to drive improvements in data center interconnect as well. So this whole upgrade cycle I think has a long life to it.---

<Reference ID:50>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Thank you, Mandy. Before discussing the outlook for our markets, I would like to reaffirm the following metrics from our 2024 financial outlook that we provided at our Virtual Investor meeting in November. We continue to expect revenue of $8.5 billion or more, non-IFRS adjusted EPS of $2.70 or more, and non-IFRS operating margin to be in the range of 5.5% to 6%.
---

<Reference ID:26>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Now turning to our guidance for the first quarter of 2024. First quarter revenues are expected to be in the range of $2.025 billion to $2.175 billion, which, if the midpoint of this range is achieved, would represent growth of 14% compared to the prior year period. First quarter non-IFRS adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.77 per share, which at the midpoint would represent an improvement of $0.25 per share or 53% compared to the first quarter of 2023. If the midpoint of our revenue and non-IFRS adjusted EPS guidance ranges are achieved, non-IFRS operating margin would be 6.0%, which would represent an increase of 80 basis points over the same period last year.
---

<Reference ID:53>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Within our HPS business, we anticipate to resume year-to-year growth in the first quarter of 2024 and for the full year. This growth is being fueled by a number of new program loans in both networking, supported by growth in our 400G and 800G platforms, and to some extent AI/ML compute. For 2024, we are maintaining our previously communicated expectation of low-double digit percentage revenue growth in our CCS segment, supported by solid growth in both our enterprise and communications end markets.
---

<Reference ID:4>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] In addition, during this call, we will refer to various non-IFRS financial measures, including ratios based on non-IFRS financial measures consisting of non-IFRS operating margin, adjusted gross margin, adjusted return on invested capital or adjusted ROIC, adjusted free cash flow, gross debt to non-IFRS trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS, adjusted SG&A expense, adjusted effective tax rate and operating earnings.
---

<Reference ID:22>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Moving onto some additional financial metrics. IFRS net earnings for the fourth quarter were $84 million or $0.70 per share compared to net earnings of $42 million or $0.35 per share in the prior year period. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 10.4% up 100 basis points year-over-year, due to improved mix and production efficiencies.
---

<Reference ID:24>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Non-IFRS adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.76 exceeding the high end of our guidance range. This result was $0.20 higher year-over-year, driven primarily by higher non-IFRS operating earnings, as well as lower interest costs, a more favorable non-IFRS adjusted effective tax rate and lower shares outstanding.
---

<Reference ID:34>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Turning to non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow. We generated $84 million in the fourth quarter compared to $43 million in the prior year period, marking our 20th consecutive quarter of positive non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow. This result brings our total free cash flow for the year to $194 million ahead of our full year outlook of $150 million and approximately double our results from 2022 of $94 million. The out performance was driven by strong profitability and working capital management.
---

<Reference ID:28>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Our fourth quarter non-IFRS operating margin of 6.0% was 70 basis points higher year-over-year and marked the highest quarterly results in the company's history. Our margin expansion was driven primarily by higher profitability in both segments, as a result of improved mix, production efficiencies, and higher volumes in our CCS segment.
---

<Reference ID:14>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Fourth quarter non-IFRS adjusted effective tax rate was 20% in the quarter compared to 23% in the prior year period. Non-IFRS adjusted ROIC for the fourth quarter was 23.3%, an improvement of 2.6% compared to the prior year quarter driven by strong profitability and working capital managements.
---

<Reference ID:49>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Thank you, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. We ended the year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving revenue of $2.14 billion, which is towards the high-end of our guidance range, while our non-IFRS adjusted EPS came in at $0.76, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our non-IFRS operating margin was 6% exceeding the midpoint of our revenue and non-IFRS adjusted EPS guidance ranges.
---

<Reference ID:30>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Similar to last quarter, the decline was driven primarily by tough comps, as some of our customers continue to digest inventory purchased in the prior year. HPS revenue was $484 million in the quarter, 1% lower year-over-year. HPS revenues were 23% of total company revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 24% in the prior year period.

As a finance expert, I did not face challenges in analyzing Celestica Inc.'s earnings call and financial performance based on the provided extracts. However, I can outline potential challenges that analysts might encounter in such an analysis:

1. **Forward-Looking Statements**: The earnings call includes forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. This introduces a level of uncertainty in the analysis and requires careful consideration of the risk factors involved <Reference ID:1>.

2. **Non-IFRS Financial Measures**: Celestica uses various non-IFRS financial measures, which do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. This requires additional effort to understand and reconcile these measures with the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures <Reference ID:5><Reference ID:4>.

3. **Customer Concentration**: The company has significant revenue concentration with one customer accounting for 29% of the quarter's revenue and 22% for the year. This concentration could pose a risk to the company's financial stability if the relationship with this customer changes <Reference ID:11>.

4. **Market and Technological Changes**: The company operates in a dynamic industry where technological advancements and market demands can rapidly change. Understanding the multi-year upgrade cycles and the impact of new technologies on the company's financial performance requires a deep understanding of the industry <Reference ID:69>.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing year-over-year performance and understanding the drivers behind changes in metrics such as non-IFRS operating margin, adjusted gross margin, and non-IFRS adjusted EPS is crucial. This involves analyzing the factors that contributed to the improvements or declines in these metrics <Reference ID:22><Reference ID:24><Reference ID:28>.

6. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company provides guidance for future performance, which needs to be analyzed in the context of past performance and industry trends. This includes assessing the reasonableness of the company's expectations for revenue growth, non-IFRS adjusted EPS, and non-IFRS operating margin <Reference ID:26><Reference ID:50><Reference ID:53>.

7. **Segment Performance**: Understanding the performance of different business segments, such as HPS and CCS, and their contribution to the overall financial results is important. This includes analyzing segment-specific trends and challenges <Reference ID:30><Reference ID:53>.

8. **Tax Rates and Capital Management**: Changes in the adjusted effective tax rate and return on invested capital (ROIC) can have significant impacts on net earnings and shareholder value. Analyzing these factors requires a comprehensive understanding of tax laws and capital management strategies <Reference ID:14>.

9. **Liquidity and Cash Flow**: Analyzing the company's liquidity position and cash flow generation is critical, especially in light of the company's consecutive quarters of positive non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow <Reference ID:34>.

Overall, while there are complexities inherent in financial analysis, the provided extracts do not indicate any specific challenges faced during the analysis of Celestica Inc.'s earnings call and financial performance.

====

The key drivers behind Celestica's revenue growth in Q4 2023 were primarily the strength in their CCS (Communications and Cloud Solutions) segment, particularly the sustained growth of their hyperscaler portfolio. The improved mix in the CCS segment margin, which reached a new high of 6.7% in the fourth quarter, also contributed to the revenue growth. Additionally, the enterprise end market saw a significant increase of 46% year-over-year, driven by ramping programs and strengthening demand for AI/ML compute from hyperscaler customers.

====

Sustainability of this growth over the next fiscal year appears positive, as the company expects continued demand strength from their hyperscaler customers through 2024 and into 2025. They have also been winning new programs with their largest hyperscaler customer, indicating a healthy relationship and potential for ongoing growth. Furthermore, the company is investing in capacity expansions at key sites to support demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs, which suggests that they are preparing to meet anticipated demand increases.

====

However, there are areas of uncertainty that could impact the sustainability of growth. The company is cautious about the capital equipment market, expecting it to be close to trough levels with a potential for modest growth in 2024. Additionally, the industrial business saw some softness due to slowing demand in certain programs and strategic inventory buffers being reduced by customers. While new program ramps in the second half of the year are expected to return the industrial business to growth, these factors introduce some variability into the revenue growth outlook.

Additionally, the enterprise end market saw a significant increase of 46% year-over-year, driven by ramping programs and strengthening demand for AI/ML compute from hyperscaler customers.\n\n", '\n\nSustainability of this growth over the next fiscal year appears positive, as the company expects continued demand strength from their hyperscaler customers through 2024 and into 2025. They have also been winning new programs with their largest hyperscaler customer, indicating a healthy relationship and potential for ongoing growth. Furthermore, the company is investing in capacity expansions at key sites to support demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs, which suggests that they are preparing to meet anticipated demand increases.\n\n', '\n\nHowever, there are areas of uncertainty that could impact the sustainability of growth. The company is cautious about the capital equipment market, expecting it to be close to trough levels with a potential for modest growth in 2024. Additionally, the industrial business saw some softness due to slowing demand in certain programs and strategic inventory buffers being reduced by customers. While new program ramps in the second half of the year are expected to return the industrial business to growth, these factors introduce some variability into the revenue growth outlook.\n\n']

The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:11>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] During the fourth quarter and for 2023, we had one customer, which accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, representing 29% for the quarter and 22% for the year. Celestica has a long standing relationship with this customer, a global hyperscaler that we have been supporting for well over a decade. We support this customer across 25 programs covering HPS and non-HPS products in the areas of networking and compute.
---

<Reference ID:12>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Enterprise end market revenue in the fourth quarter was up 46% year-over-year, meaningfully above our expectation of a high-20s percentage increase. This growth was driven by ramping programs and strengthening demand for AI/ML compute from our hyperscaler customers. Revenue in our communications end market was lower by 10% compared to the prior year period, better than our expectation of a mid-teens percentage decrease.
---

<Reference ID:47>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Now turning to our CCS segment. The demand backdrop for our CCS segment continues to be very strong. Investments from hyperscalers and data center infrastructure are fueling significant CapEx spending, driven by growing demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. In 2023, our portfolio with our hyperscalers saw revenue growth of 32% compared to 2022, recording nearly $2.9 billion in revenues. This accounted for 62% of our total CCS segment revenues in 2023, up from 51% the prior year.
---

<Reference ID:51>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] The outperformance in the fourth quarter relative to our guidance was driven by continued strength in our CCS segment, supported by the sustained growth of our hyperscaler portfolio. We continue to see the benefit of improved mix in our CCS segment margin, which reached yet another new high of 6.7% in the fourth quarter.
---

<Reference ID:39>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] At our recent Virtual Investor meeting in November, we delved further into this dynamic, which we believe is long-term and structural in nature. We anticipate this solid growth to continue in 2024 and believe that this investment cycle has the potential to support several years of strong demand for our CCS segment. The demand outlook for our enterprise and market continues to be impressive as the beneficiary of hyperscaler's growing deployment of AI/ML compute capacity.
---

<Reference ID:64>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.
---

<Reference ID:52>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] We're seeing the strong momentum from 2023 continue, and as mentioned earlier, we anticipate significant growth within our AI/ML compute portfolio as we enter 2024. We expect additional growth in our storage business to materialize in the latter half of the year, driven by demand from new programs. After experiencing some softness in 2023, demand in our communications end market is anticipated to resume year-to-year growth in the first quarter, driven by a resumption of strength in networking demand from hyperscalers, which is expected to persist throughout the year.
---

<Reference ID:35>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Turning to segment margins. ATS segment margin in the fourth quarter was 4.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong productivity and favorable mix. CCS segment margin during the quarter was 6.7%, up 80 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher volumes and improved mix, including significant growth with our hyperscaler customers.
---

<Reference ID:27>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Our fourth quarter CCS segment revenue of $1.34 billion was up 10% compared to the prior year period, driven by very strong growth in our enterprise end market, partially offset by anticipated demand softness in our communications end market. CCS segment revenue accounted for 62% of total company revenues in the quarter compared to 60% in the prior year period.
---

<Reference ID:13>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Finally, in our enterprise end market, we expect revenue to be up in the high-60s percentage range year-over-year, driven by anticipated demand growth in AI/ML compute programs from our hyperscaler customers.
---

<Reference ID:9>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] As we look to 2024, we expect our capital expenditures to modestly increase to between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues, with a higher level of spend in the first half of the year. Our increasing level of capital expenditures is geared towards capacity expansions at key sites in support of demand for AI/ML compute and HPS programs.
---

<Reference ID:53>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Within our HPS business, we anticipate to resume year-to-year growth in the first quarter of 2024 and for the full year. This growth is being fueled by a number of new program loans in both networking, supported by growth in our 400G and 800G platforms, and to some extent AI/ML compute. For 2024, we are maintaining our previously communicated expectation of low-double digit percentage revenue growth in our CCS segment, supported by solid growth in both our enterprise and communications end markets.
---

<Reference ID:69>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Yeah. And the customers in terms of their cycles to get that upgraded a little bit longer than the quarter-to-quarter discussions is, I mean it's obviously going to be demand dependent, but is that a two-year process or five-year process what's the mindset towards getting that upgrade complete? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] My sense is, it's a multi-year process. It's certainly five plus years. And again, across each of the hyperscalers that we're dealing with, each has different appetites and different phases for deployment so that they won't necessarily all overlap at once, which for at least for Celestica should give us many years of growth. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. I would add to that Todd. Again we support the top five hyperscalers, but not all the top five hyperscalers spend CapEx the same way and there's a couple in particular that sometimes are leading with the more complex technologies, and then the other hyperscalers sometimes follow. What we're really encouraged about is, where we're seeing a lot of our new winds come in and our demand outlook is with some of the hyperscalers that are at the leading edge of the more complex technologies. Hence, we're seeing the demand strengthen AI/ML computes, and we're seeing the wins come in on the 800G switches, some of which are starting to be shipped in ‘24, and then a lot more which will be shipped in 2025. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And as we see some of the other hyperscalers that follow behind that, it gives demands, it gives us an idea of the fact that this does have an opportunity to be a multi-year opportunity for us. And so when we -- and to Rob's point, we're really in the early stages right now of the AI/ML CapEx investment cycle. Of course nobody has visibility 10 years out on what things are going to look like, but we are seeing demand signals at least for the next two or three years. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And I would just close with, the adoption of some custom silicon is going to drive compute programs, and that's going to accelerate in the future. And then investments in AI is also going to drive advanced networking and that's going to be a driver in the future. And then also with our enterprise customers, we expect to see the Internet traffic is going to drive improvements in data center interconnect as well. So this whole upgrade cycle I think has a long life to it.---

<Reference ID:45>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In our capital equipment business, market forecasts continue to suggest that the underlying market demand is operating close to trough levels, and we should see flat to slightly higher demand in 2024. We are maintaining our outlook for modest revenue growth in our capital equipment business in 2024, supported by the ramping of new program wins and our assumption of base demand holding flag for 2023. We anticipate that the year-to-year growth will largely be in the back half of the year, setting up for a stronger recovery and demand in 2025.
---

<Reference ID:61>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] And just finally for me. Just to revisit, ATS, I think some of your peers have also been seeing a slowdown in their end markets over the last little bit based on customers working through their inventory buffers. Is that what you're seeing as well this quarter and can you maybe speak to within industrial and capital equipment end markets specifically, and what is causing you to expect demand to return by the second half? Is it primarily kind of those new program ramps? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] Yeah. Good question. So our industrial business in ‘23, a way of reminder, grew close to 30%. Again, it was fueled by green energy programs, including EV charging, energy storage, energy generation. As we were exiting the year, demand started cycling down in some of these markets and the markets that were really impacted were interest rate sensitive markets, but moreover, because the material environment has dramatically improved, our customers were taking the opportunity to reduce their strategic inventory buffers. We think those buffers will normalize in the first half of the year, and in the second half of the year, we have new programs, ramps planned, which would return the industrial business to growth. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] And our capital equipment business, as I mentioned earlier, we're cautiously optimistic as we get to the back half of the year and certainly into 2025 that we're seeing some signs of growth and the costs are pretty much aligned there. And again, we're seeing some spares orders. And as a reminder, some of the headwinds that we're seeing in ATS we think will be more than offset with our strength that we're seeing in our CCS business. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And then to Rob's point on capital equipment. So our assumption right now is that the base market is going to be flat. We're around trough levels right now, some encouraging signs as Rob talked about, and where we're expecting the growth to be in capital equipment is as we ramp AS/ML. AS/ML is a customer of ours for a few years now, but we've won a number of programs over the last year or so, and those programs are in the process of being ramped right now, and the demand signals from that specific customer have not changed. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And so what we're looking to do as we go to the rest of the customer base in capital equipment is to understand whether or not some of these early signs that we're seeing in terms of consumables and spares is going to lead to a demand uptick in the back end of the year. And so it's really around hyperscalers and capital equipment.
---

<Reference ID:38>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] As such, we expect to see lower revenues in our industrial portfolio through the first half of the year before seeing a return to year-to-year growth in the second half, which should result in modest growth in our industrial business for all of 2024 when compared to 2023. We continue to believe that the structural trend in markets such as EV charging, smart (ph) energy, and telematics, amongst others, remain intact and are supportive to growth in our industrial business over the long term.
---

<Reference ID:25>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Now turning to our end market and outlook for the first quarter of 2024. In our ATS segment, we anticipate revenue to be down in the low-single digit percentage range year-over-year, driven by demand softness in our industrial business and ongoing market softness in capital equipment, partly offset by continued growth in A&D. We anticipate revenues in our communications end market to be up in the low-single digit percentage range year-over-year, driven by strengthening demand and networking from hyperscaler customers, including in our HPS programs.
---

<Reference ID:46>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Now moving on to the outlook for each of our businesses. Beginning with our ATS segment, our industrial business recorded annual growth of 29% in 2023, driven by ramping programs in smart (ph) energy and EV charging. However, we began to see signs of market softness towards the end of the year, due in part to pockets of weakness in the broader economic environment, higher interest rates, as well as some delays in new program ramps.
---

<Reference ID:43>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In our ATS segment, revenues were down slightly year-to-year as incremental demand softness in our industrial business and continued demand headwinds in our capital equipment business more than offset strong growth in our A&D business. Our solid performance in the fourth quarter capped a stellar year in 2023. Throughout this past year, we continued to execute on our strategic firm, enhanced our competitive presence in key markets and consistently delivered on our financial objectives.
---

<Reference ID:21>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Moving onto our segment performance. ATS revenues in the fourth quarter were $803 million down 2% year-over-year, slightly below our expectations of a low-single digit percentage increase. The year-over-year decline in ATS segment revenue was driven by demand softness in our industrial business, primarily as a result of slowing demand in certain programs, as well as continued demand headwinds in our capital equipment business.
---

<Reference ID:65>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Okay. Thank you. Yeah. And then the second question, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. You said you're going to revisit the full year outlook, I think in Q1, but the outlook for 5.5% to 6% operating margin seems conservative given, you're doing so well in the enterprise business in CCS at 6.7% and you're entering at 6% and the guide looks like 6%. So it looks as though it's going to decelerate in the back half of the year. Maybe if you could discuss that and I'll pass on. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Yeah, Rob. I'll talk about two things. one is the outlook for the full year and then I can talk to your point on margin specifically. So, when we look at full year 2024, we're really pleased with the way we ended ‘23. And clearly, we're off to a really hot start now into the first quarter. And again, encouraged by where we're seeing the demand signals come through, both on comms and HPS, but also the demand signals from the hyperscalers continue to strengthen. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] As you know, in November, we provided the outlook of $8.5 billion or more and $2.70 of EPS or more. And right now, we really do see that as being the floor. What we are looking to do, as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks is, we're going back out to the customer base and revalidating the second half outlook. We're seeing that increased strength happening in the first half and now what we want to do is go and validate whether or not those increasing level of demand signals are going to be added to the second half as well. And so, in April, we'll come back with an updated forecast. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] To your point on the margin profile itself, as we talked about, ATS is expected to see some very minor levels of declines in the first half of this year before resuming growth in the back end of the year. ATS, again, we're expecting across all of our end markets to have some level of growth in 2024. But because that growth in the back half is going to be off the back of ramping programs, there is going to be a little bit of margin challenges around there as well. Again, 6% for the first quarter, I believe the 270 is the floor. And obviously, we're going to be working towards the high end of that 5.5% to 6% range as best we can. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] And one other thing, I would add, Rob, I think by the end of the first quarter we'll have better visibility into capital equipment markets. We are seeing some signs of recovery. We're cautiously optimistic. Some of our customers are starting to restock consumables and spares, which is a good sign. So I think as capital equipment gets better, so will some of the ATS margins as well.

---Extract: (Q&A)[Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Hi. Good morning. With respect to the full year guidance, I hear you with respect to wanting to discuss the second half outlook with your customers before revisiting the guidance. But certainly from the demand signals, you're highlighting it seems like it'll be a stronger second half. I guess from your perspective, what might be the key areas of uncertainty you want to further color on before visiting guidance? Would that be on semi and industrial, or which areas would be the biggest source of demand variability as you think about second half? (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Yeah. Hi, Thanos. Mandeep here. So we were pleased to be able to interlock with our customer base, specifically on the hyperscaler side in the fourth quarter, and that has led us to confidently come out with the outlook that we did. Even after our virtual investor meeting in November, we saw incremental improvement to the forecast coming from the hyperscalers, and so that's reflected in our Q1 guidance. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Again, our outlook is for 14% year-over-year growth, which is higher than what we would have said probably in November. And we're seeing that demand strength continue into the second quarter. So the conversations with the hyperscalers are, is there an improvement in material availability on your end? Is there -- has your deployment change -- plans changed at all? And how does that impact the second half of the year? Is it going to be similar to what we're seeing right now in the first half of the year?

The key drivers behind the revenue growth discussed in the Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call for Celestica Inc. are primarily attributed to the strong performance in the company's Capital Equipment Solutions (CCS) segment, particularly from the demand for AI/ML compute and High Performance Solutions (HPS) programs from hyperscaler customers. Here are the main factors contributing to the growth:

1. **Hyperscaler Customer Demand**: A significant portion of the revenue growth is driven by a single hyperscaler customer, which accounted for 29% of the total revenues for the quarter and 22% for the year. This customer is involved in over 25 programs across networking and compute, indicating a deep and multifaceted relationship with Celestica (<Reference ID:11>).

2. **AI/ML Compute Growth**: There has been a substantial increase in demand for AI/ML compute from hyperscaler customers, which has led to a 46% year-over-year increase in enterprise end market revenue in the fourth quarter, surpassing the expectation of a high-20s percentage increase (<Reference ID:12>).

3. **CCS Segment Performance**: The CCS segment saw a 32% revenue growth compared to 2022, with nearly $2.9 billion in revenues, accounting for 62% of the total CCS segment revenues in 2023. This growth is fueled by investments from hyperscalers in data center infrastructure, driven by the growing demand for AI and machine learning applications (<Reference ID:47>).

4. **Improved Mix in CCS Segment Margin**: The CCS segment margin reached a new high of 6.7% in the fourth quarter, supported by the sustained growth of the hyperscaler portfolio and the benefit of improved mix (<Reference ID:51>).

5. **Long-term Structural Demand**: The company anticipates this solid growth to continue into 2024 and believes that the investment cycle has the potential to support several years of strong demand for the CCS segment (<Reference ID:39>).

6. **Diversification of Hyperscaler Business**: While a large customer accounts for a significant portion of revenue, Celestica does business with the top five hyperscalers, and growth is also seen across several others in the same area. This diversification is expected to improve concentration over time (<Reference ID:64>).

7. **Resumption of Demand in Communications End Market**: After experiencing some softness in 2023, demand in the communications end market is anticipated to resume year-to-year growth in the first quarter of 2024, driven by a resumption of strength in networking demand from hyperscalers (<Reference ID:52>).

The sustainability of this growth over the next fiscal year appears to be strong, given the following:

- **Multi-Year Investment Cycle**: The company is in the early stages of the AI/ML CapEx investment cycle, with demand signals indicating at least two to three years of growth potential. The adoption of custom silicon and investments in AI are expected to drive future growth in compute programs and advanced networking (<Reference ID:69>).

- **New Program Wins**: Growth is also expected from new program wins, particularly in the storage business and networking platforms like 400G and 800G, which are anticipated to contribute to revenue growth in 2024 (<Reference ID:53>).

- **Capital Expenditure Plans**: Celestica plans to modestly increase capital expenditures to support capacity expansions at key sites for AI/ML compute and HPS programs, indicating a commitment to scaling operations to meet demand (<Reference ID:9>).

In summary, the growth is driven by strong demand from hyperscaler customers, particularly in AI/ML compute and networking, and is supported by strategic investments and new program wins. The company's management believes this growth is part of a long-term structural trend, suggesting sustainability over the next fiscal year.

Celestica's recent strategic initiatives have positively impacted its financial performance, with the company achieving a strong fourth quarter in Q4 2023. Revenue reached $2.14 billion, towards the high end of the guidance range, and non-IFRS adjusted EPS was $0.76, exceeding the high end of the guidance. The non-IFRS operating margin was 6%, exceeding the midpoint of the guidance ranges. The company's CCS segment showed continued strength, particularly from growth in the hyperscaler portfolio, leading to improved segment margins. The ATS segment experienced a slight year-to-year revenue decline due to demand softness in the industrial business and continued demand headwinds in the capital equipment business, which were partially offset by growth in the A&D business.

====

Areas where outcomes did not meet expectations include the ATS segment, where revenues were down slightly year-to-year, falling short of the expected low-single digit percentage increase. This was attributed to demand softness in the industrial business, primarily due to slowing demand in certain programs, and continued demand headwinds in the capital equipment business. The company attributes these challenges to factors such as higher interest rates, delays in new program ramps, and customers reducing strategic inventory buffers due to improved material availability.

====

Despite the challenges in the ATS segment, Celestica's overall financial performance was strong, with significant growth in both the CCS and ATS segments contributing to a 10% higher revenue compared to 2022. The non-IFRS adjusted EPS increased by 28% versus the prior year, and the non-IFRS operating margin improved by 70 basis points. The company also generated non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow of $194 million, exceeding the full-year target of $150 million. The company's strategic initiatives, particularly in the CCS segment, have led to improved mix, production efficiencies, and higher volumes, contributing to margin expansion and overall financial success.

The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:11>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] During the fourth quarter and for 2023, we had one customer, which accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, representing 29% for the quarter and 22% for the year. Celestica has a long standing relationship with this customer, a global hyperscaler that we have been supporting for well over a decade. We support this customer across 25 programs covering HPS and non-HPS products in the areas of networking and compute.
---

<Reference ID:51>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] The outperformance in the fourth quarter relative to our guidance was driven by continued strength in our CCS segment, supported by the sustained growth of our hyperscaler portfolio. We continue to see the benefit of improved mix in our CCS segment margin, which reached yet another new high of 6.7% in the fourth quarter.
---

<Reference ID:35>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Turning to segment margins. ATS segment margin in the fourth quarter was 4.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong productivity and favorable mix. CCS segment margin during the quarter was 6.7%, up 80 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher volumes and improved mix, including significant growth with our hyperscaler customers.
---

<Reference ID:40>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In 2023, our business generated revenue of approximately $8 billion, 10% higher than 2022, driven by strong growth in both our CCS and ATS segments. Our non-IFRS adjusted EPS of $2.43 was up 28% versus the prior year, while non-IFRS operating margin of 5.6% was higher by 70 basis points, with both results marking the highest in the company's history. Our strong profitability and working capital management allowed us to generate non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow of $194 million, exceeding our full year target of $150 million.
---

<Reference ID:6>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] We refer you to yesterday’s press release and our Q4 2023 earnings presentation, which are available at celestica.com under the Investor Relations tab, for more information about these and certain other non-IFRS financial measures, including a reconciliation of historical non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures from our financial statements and a description of recent modifications to specified non-IFRS financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, all references to dollars on this call are to U.S. dollars and per share information is based on diluted shares outstanding.
---

<Reference ID:31>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter revenue came in at $2.14 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Revenue was up 5% year-over-year, supported by solid growth in our CCS segment, partially offset by a modest decline in our ATS segment.
---

<Reference ID:65>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Okay. Thank you. Yeah. And then the second question, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. You said you're going to revisit the full year outlook, I think in Q1, but the outlook for 5.5% to 6% operating margin seems conservative given, you're doing so well in the enterprise business in CCS at 6.7% and you're entering at 6% and the guide looks like 6%. So it looks as though it's going to decelerate in the back half of the year. Maybe if you could discuss that and I'll pass on. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Yeah, Rob. I'll talk about two things. one is the outlook for the full year and then I can talk to your point on margin specifically. So, when we look at full year 2024, we're really pleased with the way we ended ‘23. And clearly, we're off to a really hot start now into the first quarter. And again, encouraged by where we're seeing the demand signals come through, both on comms and HPS, but also the demand signals from the hyperscalers continue to strengthen. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] As you know, in November, we provided the outlook of $8.5 billion or more and $2.70 of EPS or more. And right now, we really do see that as being the floor. What we are looking to do, as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks is, we're going back out to the customer base and revalidating the second half outlook. We're seeing that increased strength happening in the first half and now what we want to do is go and validate whether or not those increasing level of demand signals are going to be added to the second half as well. And so, in April, we'll come back with an updated forecast. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] To your point on the margin profile itself, as we talked about, ATS is expected to see some very minor levels of declines in the first half of this year before resuming growth in the back end of the year. ATS, again, we're expecting across all of our end markets to have some level of growth in 2024. But because that growth in the back half is going to be off the back of ramping programs, there is going to be a little bit of margin challenges around there as well. Again, 6% for the first quarter, I believe the 270 is the floor. And obviously, we're going to be working towards the high end of that 5.5% to 6% range as best we can. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] And one other thing, I would add, Rob, I think by the end of the first quarter we'll have better visibility into capital equipment markets. We are seeing some signs of recovery. We're cautiously optimistic. Some of our customers are starting to restock consumables and spares, which is a good sign. So I think as capital equipment gets better, so will some of the ATS margins as well.
---

<Reference ID:43>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In our ATS segment, revenues were down slightly year-to-year as incremental demand softness in our industrial business and continued demand headwinds in our capital equipment business more than offset strong growth in our A&D business. Our solid performance in the fourth quarter capped a stellar year in 2023. Throughout this past year, we continued to execute on our strategic firm, enhanced our competitive presence in key markets and consistently delivered on our financial objectives.
---

<Reference ID:25>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Now turning to our end market and outlook for the first quarter of 2024. In our ATS segment, we anticipate revenue to be down in the low-single digit percentage range year-over-year, driven by demand softness in our industrial business and ongoing market softness in capital equipment, partly offset by continued growth in A&D. We anticipate revenues in our communications end market to be up in the low-single digit percentage range year-over-year, driven by strengthening demand and networking from hyperscaler customers, including in our HPS programs.
---

<Reference ID:3>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] Good morning and thank you for joining us on Celestica’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Rob Mionis, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mandeep Chawla, Chief Financial Officer.
---

<Reference ID:21>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Moving onto our segment performance. ATS revenues in the fourth quarter were $803 million down 2% year-over-year, slightly below our expectations of a low-single digit percentage increase. The year-over-year decline in ATS segment revenue was driven by demand softness in our industrial business, primarily as a result of slowing demand in certain programs, as well as continued demand headwinds in our capital equipment business.
---

<Reference ID:33>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] These declines were partially offset by solid performance in our A&D business, which saw growth of more than 20% compared to the prior year period. ATS segment revenues accounted 38% of total revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 40% in the same period last year.
---

<Reference ID:46>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Now moving on to the outlook for each of our businesses. Beginning with our ATS segment, our industrial business recorded annual growth of 29% in 2023, driven by ramping programs in smart (ph) energy and EV charging. However, we began to see signs of market softness towards the end of the year, due in part to pockets of weakness in the broader economic environment, higher interest rates, as well as some delays in new program ramps.
---

<Reference ID:61>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] And just finally for me. Just to revisit, ATS, I think some of your peers have also been seeing a slowdown in their end markets over the last little bit based on customers working through their inventory buffers. Is that what you're seeing as well this quarter and can you maybe speak to within industrial and capital equipment end markets specifically, and what is causing you to expect demand to return by the second half? Is it primarily kind of those new program ramps? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] Yeah. Good question. So our industrial business in ‘23, a way of reminder, grew close to 30%. Again, it was fueled by green energy programs, including EV charging, energy storage, energy generation. As we were exiting the year, demand started cycling down in some of these markets and the markets that were really impacted were interest rate sensitive markets, but moreover, because the material environment has dramatically improved, our customers were taking the opportunity to reduce their strategic inventory buffers. We think those buffers will normalize in the first half of the year, and in the second half of the year, we have new programs, ramps planned, which would return the industrial business to growth. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] And our capital equipment business, as I mentioned earlier, we're cautiously optimistic as we get to the back half of the year and certainly into 2025 that we're seeing some signs of growth and the costs are pretty much aligned there. And again, we're seeing some spares orders. And as a reminder, some of the headwinds that we're seeing in ATS we think will be more than offset with our strength that we're seeing in our CCS business. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And then to Rob's point on capital equipment. So our assumption right now is that the base market is going to be flat. We're around trough levels right now, some encouraging signs as Rob talked about, and where we're expecting the growth to be in capital equipment is as we ramp AS/ML. AS/ML is a customer of ours for a few years now, but we've won a number of programs over the last year or so, and those programs are in the process of being ramped right now, and the demand signals from that specific customer have not changed. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And so what we're looking to do as we go to the rest of the customer base in capital equipment is to understand whether or not some of these early signs that we're seeing in terms of consumables and spares is going to lead to a demand uptick in the back end of the year. And so it's really around hyperscalers and capital equipment.
---

<Reference ID:44>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In our Health Tech business, we anticipate our revenue to grow in 2024 compared to 2023 as we wrap new programs. So for our overall ATS segment, we currently anticipate that revenue will decline slightly in the first half of 2024 compared to 2023 to the pockets of macro weakness affecting some of our markets. However, we anticipate that segment revenue will resume year-to-year growth in the second half of the year. Overall, we are maintaining our expectation for ATS revenue growth in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2024.
---

<Reference ID:28>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Our fourth quarter non-IFRS operating margin of 6.0% was 70 basis points higher year-over-year and marked the highest quarterly results in the company's history. Our margin expansion was driven primarily by higher profitability in both segments, as a result of improved mix, production efficiencies, and higher volumes in our CCS segment.

Celestica's recent strategic initiatives have positively impacted its financial performance, as evidenced by several key indicators. The company generated revenue of approximately $8 billion in 2023, which was 10% higher than in 2022, driven by strong growth in both its CCS and ATS segments. Non-IFRS adjusted EPS was up 28% versus the prior year, and non-IFRS operating margin increased by 70 basis points, marking the highest in the company's history. The strong profitability and working capital management also allowed Celestica to generate non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow of $194 million, exceeding the full-year target of $150 million <Reference ID:40>.

The company's CCS segment, in particular, saw significant growth, with segment margins reaching new highs due to improved mix and higher volumes, especially from hyperscaler customers <Reference ID:51><Reference ID:35>. This indicates that the strategic focus on the CCS segment and hyperscaler portfolio has been successful.

However, there were areas where outcomes did not fully meet expectations. The ATS segment experienced a slight year-over-year revenue decline, driven by demand softness in the industrial business and continued demand headwinds in the capital equipment business <Reference ID:21>. This was slightly below the company's expectations of a low-single digit percentage increase <Reference ID:21>. The decline in ATS segment revenue was partially offset by solid performance in the A&D business, which saw growth of more than 20% compared to the prior year period <Reference ID:33>.

The company began to see signs of market softness towards the end of the year in the industrial business, attributed to pockets of weakness in the broader economic environment, higher interest rates, and some delays in new program ramps <Reference ID:46>. Additionally, customers were reducing their strategic inventory buffers due to an improved material environment, which impacted demand <Reference ID:61>.

In summary, while Celestica's strategic initiatives have led to record financial performance in some areas, particularly in the CCS segment and hyperscaler customer growth, the ATS segment did not meet expectations due to macroeconomic factors and market softness in specific end markets.

**Major Risks and External Challenges:**

1. **Market Softness in Industrial Business:** The company has observed softness in the industrial business, particularly in interest rate-sensitive markets like EV charging, which is affected by a slowdown in EV sales and delays in incentives. This could impact future earnings if the slowdown persists or worsens.

2. **Demand Headwinds in Capital Equipment Business:** The capital equipment business is experiencing demand headwinds, with market forecasts suggesting that underlying market demand is operating close to trough levels. If the expected modest recovery does not materialize, it could negatively affect future earnings.

3. **Inventory Management:** As material constraints improve and lead times normalize, customers are reducing strategic inventory buffers. This could lead to fluctuations in demand and impact revenue if not managed effectively.

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Diversification:** Continue to diversify the customer base, particularly within the hyperscaler market, to reduce reliance on any single customer and mitigate concentration risk.

2. **Capacity Expansion:** Invest in capacity expansions, such as the ongoing projects in Thailand and Malaysia, to ensure the ability to meet increased demand and support new program ramps.

3. **Working Capital Management:** Maintain strong working capital management practices to manage inventory levels effectively and generate positive free cash flow, providing financial flexibility to navigate market uncertainties.

**Impact on Future Earnings:**

1. **Reduced Industrial Demand:** If the softness in the industrial business persists, it could lead to lower revenues and impact the company's growth trajectory, potentially affecting future earnings.

2. **Capital Equipment Market Recovery:** The timing and strength of the recovery in the capital equipment market are uncertain. A slower-than-expected recovery could result in lower revenues and earnings for the company.

3. **Inventory Adjustments:** The company's efforts to unwind inventory as material constraints improve could lead to variability in working capital and cash flows, impacting earnings if not managed prudently.

====

**Additional Considerations:**

1. **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** The company's industrial business is sensitive to interest rates, which could affect demand for products like EV charging. Monitoring interest rate trends and adjusting strategies accordingly is crucial.

2. **Customer Demand Signals:** The company is in discussions with customers to obtain better visibility into demand for the remainder of the year. Any significant changes in customer demand could impact earnings projections.

3. **Global Minimum Tax Legislation:** The company's tax rate assumptions include the potential impact of global minimum tax legislation. Changes in tax legislation could affect the company's financials and should be monitored closely.

The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:61>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] And just finally for me. Just to revisit, ATS, I think some of your peers have also been seeing a slowdown in their end markets over the last little bit based on customers working through their inventory buffers. Is that what you're seeing as well this quarter and can you maybe speak to within industrial and capital equipment end markets specifically, and what is causing you to expect demand to return by the second half? Is it primarily kind of those new program ramps? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] Yeah. Good question. So our industrial business in ‘23, a way of reminder, grew close to 30%. Again, it was fueled by green energy programs, including EV charging, energy storage, energy generation. As we were exiting the year, demand started cycling down in some of these markets and the markets that were really impacted were interest rate sensitive markets, but moreover, because the material environment has dramatically improved, our customers were taking the opportunity to reduce their strategic inventory buffers. We think those buffers will normalize in the first half of the year, and in the second half of the year, we have new programs, ramps planned, which would return the industrial business to growth. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] And our capital equipment business, as I mentioned earlier, we're cautiously optimistic as we get to the back half of the year and certainly into 2025 that we're seeing some signs of growth and the costs are pretty much aligned there. And again, we're seeing some spares orders. And as a reminder, some of the headwinds that we're seeing in ATS we think will be more than offset with our strength that we're seeing in our CCS business. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And then to Rob's point on capital equipment. So our assumption right now is that the base market is going to be flat. We're around trough levels right now, some encouraging signs as Rob talked about, and where we're expecting the growth to be in capital equipment is as we ramp AS/ML. AS/ML is a customer of ours for a few years now, but we've won a number of programs over the last year or so, and those programs are in the process of being ramped right now, and the demand signals from that specific customer have not changed. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And so what we're looking to do as we go to the rest of the customer base in capital equipment is to understand whether or not some of these early signs that we're seeing in terms of consumables and spares is going to lead to a demand uptick in the back end of the year. And so it's really around hyperscalers and capital equipment.

<Reference ID:67>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] That's helpful. And then on the softness in industrial, just to clarify, is that primarily lead edged in green energy or is that kind of across the board in your various end markets of an industrial? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] I thought also its pronounced mostly in EV charging, which is kind of being driven by a slowdown in EV sales and also some of the incentives, at least in the U.S. are slow to get out to the marketplace, that's having some impact as well as the higher interest rates. But we're also seeing a little bit of a slowdown in, I'll call it the broader industrial space, just driven by the burn down of strategic inventory buffers. Again, we expect some new program ramps and the burn down of the buffers for this entire industrial business to start resuming to grow from the back half of the year.
---

<Reference ID:38>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] As such, we expect to see lower revenues in our industrial portfolio through the first half of the year before seeing a return to year-to-year growth in the second half, which should result in modest growth in our industrial business for all of 2024 when compared to 2023. We continue to believe that the structural trend in markets such as EV charging, smart (ph) energy, and telematics, amongst others, remain intact and are supportive to growth in our industrial business over the long term.
---

<Reference ID:46>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Now moving on to the outlook for each of our businesses. Beginning with our ATS segment, our industrial business recorded annual growth of 29% in 2023, driven by ramping programs in smart (ph) energy and EV charging. However, we began to see signs of market softness towards the end of the year, due in part to pockets of weakness in the broader economic environment, higher interest rates, as well as some delays in new program ramps.

---Extract: (Q&A)[Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Hi. Good morning. With respect to the full year guidance, I hear you with respect to wanting to discuss the second half outlook with your customers before revisiting the guidance. But certainly from the demand signals, you're highlighting it seems like it'll be a stronger second half. I guess from your perspective, what might be the key areas of uncertainty you want to further color on before visiting guidance? Would that be on semi and industrial, or which areas would be the biggest source of demand variability as you think about second half? (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Yeah. Hi, Thanos. Mandeep here. So we were pleased to be able to interlock with our customer base, specifically on the hyperscaler side in the fourth quarter, and that has led us to confidently come out with the outlook that we did. Even after our virtual investor meeting in November, we saw incremental improvement to the forecast coming from the hyperscalers, and so that's reflected in our Q1 guidance. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Again, our outlook is for 14% year-over-year growth, which is higher than what we would have said probably in November. And we're seeing that demand strength continue into the second quarter. So the conversations with the hyperscalers are, is there an improvement in material availability on your end? Is there -- has your deployment change -- plans changed at all? And how does that impact the second half of the year? Is it going to be similar to what we're seeing right now in the first half of the year?
---

<Reference ID:25>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Now turning to our end market and outlook for the first quarter of 2024. In our ATS segment, we anticipate revenue to be down in the low-single digit percentage range year-over-year, driven by demand softness in our industrial business and ongoing market softness in capital equipment, partly offset by continued growth in A&D. We anticipate revenues in our communications end market to be up in the low-single digit percentage range year-over-year, driven by strengthening demand and networking from hyperscaler customers, including in our HPS programs.
---

<Reference ID:45>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In our capital equipment business, market forecasts continue to suggest that the underlying market demand is operating close to trough levels, and we should see flat to slightly higher demand in 2024. We are maintaining our outlook for modest revenue growth in our capital equipment business in 2024, supported by the ramping of new program wins and our assumption of base demand holding flag for 2023. We anticipate that the year-to-year growth will largely be in the back half of the year, setting up for a stronger recovery and demand in 2025.
---

<Reference ID:64>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.

<Reference ID:21>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Moving onto our segment performance. ATS revenues in the fourth quarter were $803 million down 2% year-over-year, slightly below our expectations of a low-single digit percentage increase. The year-over-year decline in ATS segment revenue was driven by demand softness in our industrial business, primarily as a result of slowing demand in certain programs, as well as continued demand headwinds in our capital equipment business.
---

<Reference ID:7>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And in Malaysia, we are building more than 80,000 square feet of capacity to support strong demand from customers in our CCS segment, including our HPS business. This edition is expected to be online in the first half of 2024.
---

<Reference ID:58>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Okay. And just lastly, Mandeep, you talked about you basically increased your cash flow guidance for the year while keeping everything else intact. What are the reasons for that? Is that a function of the inventory reduction and working capital reduction and the cash flows from that or anything else? (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. So we continue to be encouraged that the material environment is stabilizing and improving. We're seeing lead times right now, not necessarily at pre-pandemic levels for both passes (ph) and semis, but we are seeing them drop pretty close to that level and they've been improving quarter-to-quarter. We have been unwinding inventory as a result, so we're pleased that we're able to reduce some of that cash. Really strong finish 2023, $194 million, we believe that that is the right goal as a minimum for next year on the back of increasing profitability and an inventory environment that we think is going to continue to improve. And so we think the goal of $200 billion or more reflects a good level of conversion and is the right target at this time.
---

<Reference ID:43>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In our ATS segment, revenues were down slightly year-to-year as incremental demand softness in our industrial business and continued demand headwinds in our capital equipment business more than offset strong growth in our A&D business. Our solid performance in the fourth quarter capped a stellar year in 2023. Throughout this past year, we continued to execute on our strategic firm, enhanced our competitive presence in key markets and consistently delivered on our financial objectives.
---

<Reference ID:36>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] When accounting for cash deposits, inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was lower by $323 million on a year-over-year basis and lower by $185 million sequentially. Inventory days, net of cash deposit days were 62 in the fourth quarter compared to 79 in the prior year period. We are pleased with the improvements we are seeing in inventory as material constraints continue to improve and [indiscernible] lead times normalize. Cash cycle days were 72 during the fourth quarter, flat sequentially, and 8 days higher than the prior year period.
---

<Reference ID:23>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Non-IFRS adjusted SG&A expense for the first quarter is expected to be in the range of $62 million to $64 million. We anticipate our non-IFRS adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the first quarter, excluding any impact from taxable foreign exchange or unanticipated tax elements. Our first quarter guidance assumes that our income will be subject to global minimum tax, as legislation that has been introduced in Canada may be approved before the end of the quarter. If this legislation is not substantially enacted in the first quarter, our estimate for our first quarter non-IR4S adjusted effective tax rate would be approximately 15%.
---

<Reference ID:24>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Non-IFRS adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.76 exceeding the high end of our guidance range. This result was $0.20 higher year-over-year, driven primarily by higher non-IFRS operating earnings, as well as lower interest costs, a more favorable non-IFRS adjusted effective tax rate and lower shares outstanding.
---

<Reference ID:14>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Fourth quarter non-IFRS adjusted effective tax rate was 20% in the quarter compared to 23% in the prior year period. Non-IFRS adjusted ROIC for the fourth quarter was 23.3%, an improvement of 2.6% compared to the prior year quarter driven by strong profitability and working capital managements.
---

<Reference ID:37>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Although, we are seeing some divergence in the short-term demand dynamics underlying our various end markets, we believe that the fundamentals supporting our overall business are very constructive due to the benefits of our strategic portfolio diversification and our consistent execution. We feel that our positioning for 2024 remains positive, as we remain confident in our ability to meet our financial outlook and improve on our very strong performance in 2023.
---

<Reference ID:55>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] Appreciate it. Thanks for that. And the final question, you also mentioned the ramp up of some of these sites. Just wondering whether you have enough capacity to deal with the near-term demand that's coming in throughout this year and how those discussions are going on your ability to service some of that demand? Thank you. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Yeah. Thanks. We've been interlocking with our customers and been investing forward on capacity expansions, mainly in Thailand. We have a couple of phases, and also in Malaysia, a phase is coming online in February, we've been cutting, frankly. So yes, we do have enough capacity, and it's coming online, very much aligned with the demand state, I would say. And these are also highly automated factories, highly automated test centers, so they're really producing a lot of productivity.

Celestica Inc. is currently facing several major risks and external challenges that could impact future earnings:

1. **Market Softness in ATS Segment**: The company has experienced demand softness in its industrial business, particularly in programs related to smart energy and EV charging, due to broader economic weakness and higher interest rates (<Reference ID:46>). This softness is expected to continue through the first half of the year before a return to growth in the second half (<Reference ID:38>).

2. **Inventory Buffer Reduction**: Customers are reducing their strategic inventory buffers, which has led to a cycling down of demand in markets sensitive to interest rates (<Reference ID:61>).

3. **Interest Rate Sensitivity**: Higher interest rates have impacted interest rate-sensitive markets, contributing to the slowdown in demand (<Reference ID:61>).

4. **Capital Equipment Market Softness**: The capital equipment business is experiencing ongoing market softness, with the base market expected to be flat and around trough levels (<Reference ID:45>).

5. **EV Charging Slowdown**: There has been a pronounced slowdown in EV charging, driven by a decrease in EV sales and delays in the rollout of incentives, particularly in the U.S. (<Reference ID:67>).

6. **Global Minimum Tax Legislation**: The company is anticipating that its income will be subject to global minimum tax, pending legislation in Canada, which could affect its effective tax rate (<Reference ID:23>).

To mitigate these risks and challenges, Celestica could consider the following strategies:

- **Diversification**: Continue to diversify its portfolio to reduce reliance on any single market or customer, as mentioned by the CEO, the company's strategic portfolio diversification is a key benefit (<Reference ID:37>).

- **Capacity Expansion**: Invest in capacity expansions to ensure they can meet demand when it returns, as they are doing in Thailand and Malaysia (<Reference ID:55>).

- **Inventory Management**: Maintain strong inventory management practices to improve cash flow and reduce the impact of material constraints, as they have been doing by unwinding inventory (<Reference ID:58>).

- **New Program Ramps**: Focus on ramping up new programs, particularly in the second half of the year, to return the industrial business to growth (<Reference ID:61>).

- **Customer Interlock**: Continue to engage with customers to understand their demand forecasts and adjust the company's production and investment plans accordingly (<Reference ID:66>).

- **Cost Management**: Keep a close eye on costs, including SG&A expenses, to maintain profitability during periods of softer demand (<Reference ID:23>).

- **Monitoring Interest Rates**: Keep abreast of interest rate changes and their potential impact on customer demand, adjusting strategies as necessary.

By implementing these strategies, Celestica can better navigate the current risks and challenges, positioning itself for a return to growth in the latter part of the year and beyond.

====

The company's operations and financial performance are affected by global economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation trends, and currency fluctuations, through demand softness in certain segments. For instance, the industrial business within the ATS segment experienced slowing demand in programs sensitive to higher interest rates. Additionally, the company's capital equipment business faced demand headwinds, which could be influenced by broader economic factors.

====

Celestica Inc. has seen a mixed impact from global economic conditions on its financial performance. While there has been softness in demand within the industrial and capital equipment businesses, potentially due to higher interest rates and economic uncertainty, the company has also experienced strong growth in other areas such as the A&D business and the CCS segment, particularly from hyperscaler customers investing in AI/ML compute capacity.

====

Currency fluctuations, interest rates, and inflation trends have had a varied impact on Celestica Inc.'s financial performance. The company's industrial business within the ATS segment saw demand softness, which could be partially attributed to economic conditions affecting interest rate-sensitive markets. However, the company's overall performance has been strong, with record non-IFRS operating margins and adjusted EPS, driven by improved mix, production efficiencies, and higher volumes in the CCS segment.

2024-02-07 21:03:52,726 INFO: 
The following are the extracts with their respective IDs from the Earnings Conference Call 2024 that you have to use to answer the user's query:
<Reference ID:21>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Moving onto our segment performance. ATS revenues in the fourth quarter were $803 million down 2% year-over-year, slightly below our expectations of a low-single digit percentage increase. The year-over-year decline in ATS segment revenue was driven by demand softness in our industrial business, primarily as a result of slowing demand in certain programs, as well as continued demand headwinds in our capital equipment business.
---

<Reference ID:43>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In our ATS segment, revenues were down slightly year-to-year as incremental demand softness in our industrial business and continued demand headwinds in our capital equipment business more than offset strong growth in our A&D business. Our solid performance in the fourth quarter capped a stellar year in 2023. Throughout this past year, we continued to execute on our strategic firm, enhanced our competitive presence in key markets and consistently delivered on our financial objectives.
---

<Reference ID:61>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] And just finally for me. Just to revisit, ATS, I think some of your peers have also been seeing a slowdown in their end markets over the last little bit based on customers working through their inventory buffers. Is that what you're seeing as well this quarter and can you maybe speak to within industrial and capital equipment end markets specifically, and what is causing you to expect demand to return by the second half? Is it primarily kind of those new program ramps? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] Yeah. Good question. So our industrial business in ‘23, a way of reminder, grew close to 30%. Again, it was fueled by green energy programs, including EV charging, energy storage, energy generation. As we were exiting the year, demand started cycling down in some of these markets and the markets that were really impacted were interest rate sensitive markets, but moreover, because the material environment has dramatically improved, our customers were taking the opportunity to reduce their strategic inventory buffers. We think those buffers will normalize in the first half of the year, and in the second half of the year, we have new programs, ramps planned, which would return the industrial business to growth. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] And our capital equipment business, as I mentioned earlier, we're cautiously optimistic as we get to the back half of the year and certainly into 2025 that we're seeing some signs of growth and the costs are pretty much aligned there. And again, we're seeing some spares orders. And as a reminder, some of the headwinds that we're seeing in ATS we think will be more than offset with our strength that we're seeing in our CCS business. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And then to Rob's point on capital equipment. So our assumption right now is that the base market is going to be flat. We're around trough levels right now, some encouraging signs as Rob talked about, and where we're expecting the growth to be in capital equipment is as we ramp AS/ML. AS/ML is a customer of ours for a few years now, but we've won a number of programs over the last year or so, and those programs are in the process of being ramped right now, and the demand signals from that specific customer have not changed. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And so what we're looking to do as we go to the rest of the customer base in capital equipment is to understand whether or not some of these early signs that we're seeing in terms of consumables and spares is going to lead to a demand uptick in the back end of the year. And so it's really around hyperscalers and capital equipment.
---

<Reference ID:25>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Now turning to our end market and outlook for the first quarter of 2024. In our ATS segment, we anticipate revenue to be down in the low-single digit percentage range year-over-year, driven by demand softness in our industrial business and ongoing market softness in capital equipment, partly offset by continued growth in A&D. We anticipate revenues in our communications end market to be up in the low-single digit percentage range year-over-year, driven by strengthening demand and networking from hyperscaler customers, including in our HPS programs.
---

<Reference ID:46>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Now moving on to the outlook for each of our businesses. Beginning with our ATS segment, our industrial business recorded annual growth of 29% in 2023, driven by ramping programs in smart (ph) energy and EV charging. However, we began to see signs of market softness towards the end of the year, due in part to pockets of weakness in the broader economic environment, higher interest rates, as well as some delays in new program ramps.
---

<Reference ID:33>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] These declines were partially offset by solid performance in our A&D business, which saw growth of more than 20% compared to the prior year period. ATS segment revenues accounted 38% of total revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 40% in the same period last year.
---

<Reference ID:65>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Okay. Thank you. Yeah. And then the second question, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. You said you're going to revisit the full year outlook, I think in Q1, but the outlook for 5.5% to 6% operating margin seems conservative given, you're doing so well in the enterprise business in CCS at 6.7% and you're entering at 6% and the guide looks like 6%. So it looks as though it's going to decelerate in the back half of the year. Maybe if you could discuss that and I'll pass on. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Yeah, Rob. I'll talk about two things. one is the outlook for the full year and then I can talk to your point on margin specifically. So, when we look at full year 2024, we're really pleased with the way we ended ‘23. And clearly, we're off to a really hot start now into the first quarter. And again, encouraged by where we're seeing the demand signals come through, both on comms and HPS, but also the demand signals from the hyperscalers continue to strengthen. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] As you know, in November, we provided the outlook of $8.5 billion or more and $2.70 of EPS or more. And right now, we really do see that as being the floor. What we are looking to do, as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks is, we're going back out to the customer base and revalidating the second half outlook. We're seeing that increased strength happening in the first half and now what we want to do is go and validate whether or not those increasing level of demand signals are going to be added to the second half as well. And so, in April, we'll come back with an updated forecast. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] To your point on the margin profile itself, as we talked about, ATS is expected to see some very minor levels of declines in the first half of this year before resuming growth in the back end of the year. ATS, again, we're expecting across all of our end markets to have some level of growth in 2024. But because that growth in the back half is going to be off the back of ramping programs, there is going to be a little bit of margin challenges around there as well. Again, 6% for the first quarter, I believe the 270 is the floor. And obviously, we're going to be working towards the high end of that 5.5% to 6% range as best we can. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] And one other thing, I would add, Rob, I think by the end of the first quarter we'll have better visibility into capital equipment markets. We are seeing some signs of recovery. We're cautiously optimistic. Some of our customers are starting to restock consumables and spares, which is a good sign. So I think as capital equipment gets better, so will some of the ATS margins as well.
---

<Reference ID:67>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] That's helpful. And then on the softness in industrial, just to clarify, is that primarily lead edged in green energy or is that kind of across the board in your various end markets of an industrial? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] I thought also its pronounced mostly in EV charging, which is kind of being driven by a slowdown in EV sales and also some of the incentives, at least in the U.S. are slow to get out to the marketplace, that's having some impact as well as the higher interest rates. But we're also seeing a little bit of a slowdown in, I'll call it the broader industrial space, just driven by the burn down of strategic inventory buffers. Again, we expect some new program ramps and the burn down of the buffers for this entire industrial business to start resuming to grow from the back half of the year.
---

<Reference ID:45>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In our capital equipment business, market forecasts continue to suggest that the underlying market demand is operating close to trough levels, and we should see flat to slightly higher demand in 2024. We are maintaining our outlook for modest revenue growth in our capital equipment business in 2024, supported by the ramping of new program wins and our assumption of base demand holding flag for 2023. We anticipate that the year-to-year growth will largely be in the back half of the year, setting up for a stronger recovery and demand in 2025.
---

<Reference ID:44>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In our Health Tech business, we anticipate our revenue to grow in 2024 compared to 2023 as we wrap new programs. So for our overall ATS segment, we currently anticipate that revenue will decline slightly in the first half of 2024 compared to 2023 to the pockets of macro weakness affecting some of our markets. However, we anticipate that segment revenue will resume year-to-year growth in the second half of the year. Overall, we are maintaining our expectation for ATS revenue growth in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2024.

<Reference ID:64>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO, Robert Young - Canaccord] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO, Robert Young - Canaccord] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.
---

<Reference ID:69>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Yeah. And the customers in terms of their cycles to get that upgraded a little bit longer than the quarter-to-quarter discussions is, I mean it's obviously going to be demand dependent, but is that a two-year process or five-year process what's the mindset towards getting that upgrade complete? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] My sense is, it's a multi-year process. It's certainly five plus years. And again, across each of the hyperscalers that we're dealing with, each has different appetites and different phases for deployment so that they won't necessarily all overlap at once, which for at least for Celestica should give us many years of growth. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. I would add to that Todd. Again we support the top five hyperscalers, but not all the top five hyperscalers spend CapEx the same way and there's a couple in particular that sometimes are leading with the more complex technologies, and then the other hyperscalers sometimes follow. What we're really encouraged about is, where we're seeing a lot of our new winds come in and our demand outlook is with some of the hyperscalers that are at the leading edge of the more complex technologies. Hence, we're seeing the demand strengthen AI/ML computes, and we're seeing the wins come in on the 800G switches, some of which are starting to be shipped in ‘24, and then a lot more which will be shipped in 2025. (Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And as we see some of the other hyperscalers that follow behind that, it gives demands, it gives us an idea of the fact that this does have an opportunity to be a multi-year opportunity for us. And so when we -- and to Rob's point, we're really in the early stages right now of the AI/ML CapEx investment cycle. Of course nobody has visibility 10 years out on what things are going to look like, but we are seeing demand signals at least for the next two or three years. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And I would just close with, the adoption of some custom silicon is going to drive compute programs, and that's going to accelerate in the future. And then investments in AI is also going to drive advanced networking and that's going to be a driver in the future. And then also with our enterprise customers, we expect to see the Internet traffic is going to drive improvements in data center interconnect as well. So this whole upgrade cycle I think has a long life to it.---

<Reference ID:11>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] During the fourth quarter and for 2023, we had one customer, which accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, representing 29% for the quarter and 22% for the year. Celestica has a long standing relationship with this customer, a global hyperscaler that we have been supporting for well over a decade. We support this customer across 25 programs covering HPS and non-HPS products in the areas of networking and compute.
---

<Reference ID:47>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Now turning to our CCS segment. The demand backdrop for our CCS segment continues to be very strong. Investments from hyperscalers and data center infrastructure are fueling significant CapEx spending, driven by growing demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. In 2023, our portfolio with our hyperscalers saw revenue growth of 32% compared to 2022, recording nearly $2.9 billion in revenues. This accounted for 62% of our total CCS segment revenues in 2023, up from 51% the prior year.
---

<Reference ID:39>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] At our recent Virtual Investor meeting in November, we delved further into this dynamic, which we believe is long-term and structural in nature. We anticipate this solid growth to continue in 2024 and believe that this investment cycle has the potential to support several years of strong demand for our CCS segment. The demand outlook for our enterprise and market continues to be impressive as the beneficiary of hyperscaler's growing deployment of AI/ML compute capacity.

<Reference ID:6>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] We refer you to yesterday’s press release and our Q4 2023 earnings presentation, which are available at celestica.com under the Investor Relations tab, for more information about these and certain other non-IFRS financial measures, including a reconciliation of historical non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures from our financial statements and a description of recent modifications to specified non-IFRS financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, all references to dollars on this call are to U.S. dollars and per share information is based on diluted shares outstanding.

<Reference ID:3>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Craig Oberg - VP, IR & Corporate Development] Good morning and thank you for joining us on Celestica’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Rob Mionis, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mandeep Chawla, Chief Financial Officer.

<Reference ID:59>
---Extract: (Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Pro CCS, okay. Perfect. And then the capacity adds in Thailand and Malaysia. Rob, could you give us a ballpark in terms of the revenue production capacity in each of those or combined? And is that incremental revenue where there are basically new programs or new capacity versus shifting from another region? (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Look, what I can tell you, Matt is, how much square foot we're adding and that the capacity improvements are a couple of folds. One, phase 1, if you will, which is coming online this quarter is about 28,000 square feet of manufacturing space. It's really a AI/ML testing facility. So it's a test farm -- for fully automated test farm for all AI/ML products. So that's coming online right about now. (Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And then phase 2 will be the first half of 2025 and that's a combined productivity play of where we're combining all our warehousing in Thailand into one facility to save on space and drive productivity and also adding about 156,000 I mean 130,000 of plus of manufacturing space, which is going to support existing and new customers as well largely around AI/ML. And we think those capacity expansions should take care of us through the next couple of years of growth.
---

<Reference ID:51>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] The outperformance in the fourth quarter relative to our guidance was driven by continued strength in our CCS segment, supported by the sustained growth of our hyperscaler portfolio. We continue to see the benefit of improved mix in our CCS segment margin, which reached yet another new high of 6.7% in the fourth quarter.
---

<Reference ID:40>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In 2023, our business generated revenue of approximately $8 billion, 10% higher than 2022, driven by strong growth in both our CCS and ATS segments. Our non-IFRS adjusted EPS of $2.43 was up 28% versus the prior year, while non-IFRS operating margin of 5.6% was higher by 70 basis points, with both results marking the highest in the company's history. Our strong profitability and working capital management allowed us to generate non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow of $194 million, exceeding our full year target of $150 million.
---

<Reference ID:35>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Turning to segment margins. ATS segment margin in the fourth quarter was 4.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong productivity and favorable mix. CCS segment margin during the quarter was 6.7%, up 80 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher volumes and improved mix, including significant growth with our hyperscaler customers.
---

<Reference ID:31>
---Extract: (Presentation)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter revenue came in at $2.14 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Revenue was up 5% year-over-year, supported by solid growth in our CCS segment, partially offset by a modest decline in our ATS segment.

Celestica Inc.'s operations and financial performance have been influenced by various global economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation trends, and currency fluctuations. Here's how these factors have impacted the company:

1. **Interest Rates**: Higher interest rates have affected demand in interest rate-sensitive markets within Celestica's industrial business. This has led to a slowdown in demand for certain programs, particularly in the EV charging sector, which has been impacted by a slowdown in EV sales and delays in the rollout of incentives in the U.S. market <Reference ID:67>.

2. **Inventory Management**: The improved material environment has allowed customers to reduce their strategic inventory buffers, which has contributed to demand softness in the industrial business. However, the company expects these buffers to normalize in the first half of the year, with new program ramps planned for the second half, which should return the industrial business to growth <Reference ID:61>.

3. **Capital Equipment Business**: The capital equipment business has faced ongoing market softness, with market forecasts suggesting that underlying demand is operating close to trough levels. Despite this, Celestica maintains a modest revenue growth outlook for this business in 2024, supported by new program wins and the assumption that base demand will hold steady <Reference ID:45>.

4. **Currency Fluctuations**: While specific mentions of currency fluctuations were not provided in the extracts, such fluctuations can impact multinational companies like Celestica by affecting the cost of inputs, pricing of products and services, and the translation of foreign revenues into U.S. dollars. The company's financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, and per share information is based on diluted shares outstanding <Reference ID:6>.

Overall, Celestica's management is navigating these economic conditions by focusing on areas of growth, such as the A&D business, which saw more than 20% growth compared to the prior year <Reference ID:33>, and by capitalizing on the strong demand from hyperscaler customers in the CCS segment <Reference ID:47>. Despite some pockets of macro weakness affecting certain markets, the company anticipates revenue growth in the mid-single digit percentage range for the ATS segment in 2024 <Reference ID:44>.
