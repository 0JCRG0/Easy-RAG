(Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] And then, we've seen a lot of new data center leasing activity. So just curious on the timing of this communications ramp as you guys are expecting 800G to ramp into 2025. So with all these new data centers coming online, are these new builds going to have 800G in them or will they leverage 400G to begin with? So just wondering, like, with them building out all these new data centers this year, whether they're going to be putting a lot of that next generation stuff or whether they're going with current generation equipment.
(Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] Appreciate it. Thanks for that. And the final question, you also mentioned the ramp up of some of these sites. Just wondering whether you have enough capacity to deal with the near-term demand that's coming in throughout this year and how those discussions are going on your ability to service some of that demand? Thank you.
(Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] Great. Thanks.
(Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] Hi. Good morning. Congrats on a strong quarter here. So communications was stronger than expected this quarter, was that driven by AI demand strength or was that from non-AI related cloud demand where we're also starting to see some early signs of recovery?

(Q&A)[Daniel Chan - TD Securities] Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stiefel. Please go ahead.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] 
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Again, our outlook is for 14% year-over-year growth, which is higher than what we would have said probably in November. And we're seeing that demand strength continue into the second quarter. So the conversations with the hyperscalers are, is there an improvement in material availability on your end? Is there -- has your deployment change -- plans changed at all? And how does that impact the second half of the year? Is it going to be similar to what we're seeing right now in the first half of the year?
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And as we see some of the other hyperscalers that follow behind that, it gives demands, it gives us an idea of the fact that this does have an opportunity to be a multi-year opportunity for us. And so when we -- and to Rob's point, we're really in the early stages right now of the AI/ML CapEx investment cycle. Of course nobody has visibility 10 years out on what things are going to look like, but we are seeing demand signals at least for the next two or three years.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And so what we're looking to do as we go to the rest of the customer base in capital equipment is to understand whether or not some of these early signs that we're seeing in terms of consumables and spares is going to lead to a demand uptick in the back end of the year. And so it's really around hyperscalers and capital equipment.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] And then to Rob's point on capital equipment. So our assumption right now is that the base market is going to be flat. We're around trough levels right now, some encouraging signs as Rob talked about, and where we're expecting the growth to be in capital equipment is as we ramp AS/ML. AS/ML is a customer of ours for a few years now, but we've won a number of programs over the last year or so, and those programs are in the process of being ramped right now, and the demand signals from that specific customer have not changed.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] As you know, in November, we provided the outlook of $8.5 billion or more and $2.70 of EPS or more. And right now, we really do see that as being the floor. What we are looking to do, as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks is, we're going back out to the customer base and revalidating the second half outlook. We're seeing that increased strength happening in the first half and now what we want to do is go and validate whether or not those increasing level of demand signals are going to be added to the second half as well. And so, in April, we'll come back with an updated forecast.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] I would just add to that, Rob that, as a reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI/ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some return and demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base and we're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions, and those are offerings that we provide across the customer base.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] On a revenue basis, yes.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] One of the things that we are seeing, Dan, is that within some of our customers' CapEx spending, they are shifting CapEx towards AI applications, and so making a decision to refresh certain data centers over other data centers. In addition to that, what we're also seeing is that for some of the customers, as silicon becomes available, they're looking for 400G solutions while they wait for 800G to be available in 2025 as it goes through the design cycle, etc. So we are seeing a shift of investment towards AI applications, and sometimes that's at the expense of more traditional cloud applications.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Operator
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Todd Copeland from CIBC. Please go ahead.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Thanks, Matt.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] To your point on the margin profile itself, as we talked about, ATS is expected to see some very minor levels of declines in the first half of this year before resuming growth in the back end of the year. ATS, again, we're expecting across all of our end markets to have some level of growth in 2024. But because that growth in the back half is going to be off the back of ramping programs, there is going to be a little bit of margin challenges around there as well. Again, 6% for the first quarter, I believe the 270 is the floor. And obviously, we're going to be working towards the high end of that 5.5% to 6% range as best we can.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] What we have seen though is that after the interlocks, requests from customers to say, can you give me actually more product and can you give it to me sooner than what I had originally asked for? And so that's what's filling in right now Q1 and Q2. And so the conversations with the customers are around have you changed your outlook for the back half of the year and what is driving that? Is it because you're accelerating data center deployments? Is it because there is a better level of availability (ph) which is happening? And then how does that impact the last two quarters the way it's impacting the first two quarters? So positive conversations for sure. And we do have a level of visibility is to really see if we can increase the numbers or not.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah, Rob. I'll talk about two things. one is the outlook for the full year and then I can talk to your point on margin specifically. So, when we look at full year 2024, we're really pleased with the way we ended ‘23. And clearly, we're off to a really hot start now into the first quarter. And again, encouraged by where we're seeing the demand signals come through, both on comms and HPS, but also the demand signals from the hyperscalers continue to strengthen.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. Good morning Matt. So we do have from our legacy OEM accounts a little bit of seasonality in our first quarter. And as such, I think you can think about the first quarter revenue number being the low point for the year. We are looking for sequential improvement as we go into the second quarter. And then again, just wanted to maybe clarify some of the wording, which is, we do have an interlock with our customer base in the back half of the year. And that interlock gives us the confidence to be able to say the outlook that we're getting, which is right now we believe the 8.5 billion should be the floor.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. Hi, Thanos. Mandeep here. So we were pleased to be able to interlock with our customer base, specifically on the hyperscaler side in the fourth quarter, and that has led us to confidently come out with the outlook that we did. Even after our virtual investor meeting in November, we saw incremental improvement to the forecast coming from the hyperscalers, and so that's reflected in our Q1 guidance.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. I would add to that Todd. Again we support the top five hyperscalers, but not all the top five hyperscalers spend CapEx the same way and there's a couple in particular that sometimes are leading with the more complex technologies, and then the other hyperscalers sometimes follow. What we're really encouraged about is, where we're seeing a lot of our new winds come in and our demand outlook is with some of the hyperscalers that are at the leading edge of the more complex technologies. Hence, we're seeing the demand strengthen AI/ML computes, and we're seeing the wins come in on the 800G switches, some of which are starting to be shipped in ‘24, and then a lot more which will be shipped in 2025.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yeah. So we continue to be encouraged that the material environment is stabilizing and improving. We're seeing lead times right now, not necessarily at pre-pandemic levels for both passes (ph) and semis, but we are seeing them drop pretty close to that level and they've been improving quarter-to-quarter. We have been unwinding inventory as a result, so we're pleased that we're able to reduce some of that cash. Really strong finish 2023, $194 million, we believe that that is the right goal as a minimum for next year on the back of increasing profitability and an inventory environment that we think is going to continue to improve. And so we think the goal of $200 billion or more reflects a good level of conversion and is the right target at this time.
(Q&A)[Mandeep Chawla - CFO] Yes. We would expect higher revenues in Q2 than we do in Q1.
(Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] 
(Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] And so based on that, would you expect the Q2 to be up sequentially then again?
(Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Okay. And just lastly, Mandeep, you talked about you basically increased your cash flow guidance for the year while keeping everything else intact. What are the reasons for that? Is that a function of the inventory reduction and working capital reduction and the cash flows from that or anything else?
(Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Okay. Thank you.
(Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Pro CCS, okay. Perfect. And then the capacity adds in Thailand and Malaysia. Rob, could you give us a ballpark in terms of the revenue production capacity in each of those or combined? And is that incremental revenue where there are basically new programs or new capacity versus shifting from another region?
(Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] What's that?
(Q&A)[Matt Sheerin - Stifel] Yes. Thank you. Good morning. My first question just wanted to go circle back to the guidance for CCS and understanding sort of lack of visibility into the back half. But just looking at Q2, I know you have some visibility. Obviously, you're going to be up in enterprise high-60s year-over-year. And I know there's a lot of lumpiness in that business where you're up double-digits one quarter and then there's a digestion period. So what should we think about, Mandeep, in terms of modeling at least sort of the first half into Q3 in terms of seasonality and obviously there's not a lot of seasonality, it's different, but how should we think about that, the cadence there?
(Q&A)[Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] 
(Q&A)[Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] And just finally for me. Just to revisit, ATS, I think some of your peers have also been seeing a slowdown in their end markets over the last little bit based on customers working through their inventory buffers. Is that what you're seeing as well this quarter and can you maybe speak to within industrial and capital equipment end markets specifically, and what is causing you to expect demand to return by the second half? Is it primarily kind of those new program ramps?
(Q&A)[Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] Got it. And on the hyperscalers, is there any changes from your last update, I guess, in November on your hyperscaler customer programs and your expected demand over the next few quarters? And I know you talked about a new program wins with your largest customer, is that something that you anticipated in previous quarters or is that something that's new?
(Q&A)[Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] Great. Thanks. I'll pass the line.
(Q&A)[Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] Hi, good morning. Just on the Communications segment, has there been any changes to your expectation for the networking growth to resume in Q1, or is it just the OEM business that's offsetting the hyperscaler strength? I think I see that the guidance implies a core record deceleration. So is that to mean that, that is primarily because of the OEM business softness?
(Q&A)[Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] Operator
(Q&A)[Maxim Matushansky - RBC Capital Markets] Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Thanos Moschopoulos from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] 
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And I would just close with, the adoption of some custom silicon is going to drive compute programs, and that's going to accelerate in the future. And then investments in AI is also going to drive advanced networking and that's going to be a driver in the future. And then also with our enterprise customers, we expect to see the Internet traffic is going to drive improvements in data center interconnect as well. So this whole upgrade cycle I think has a long life to it.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And one other thing, I would add, Rob, I think by the end of the first quarter we'll have better visibility into capital equipment markets. We are seeing some signs of recovery. We're cautiously optimistic. Some of our customers are starting to restock consumables and spares, which is a good sign. So I think as capital equipment gets better, so will some of the ATS margins as well.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And our capital equipment business, as I mentioned earlier, we're cautiously optimistic as we get to the back half of the year and certainly into 2025 that we're seeing some signs of growth and the costs are pretty much aligned there. And again, we're seeing some spares orders. And as a reminder, some of the headwinds that we're seeing in ATS we think will be more than offset with our strength that we're seeing in our CCS business.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] And then phase 2 will be the first half of 2025 and that's a combined productivity play of where we're combining all our warehousing in Thailand into one facility to save on space and drive productivity and also adding about 156,000 I mean 130,000 of plus of manufacturing space, which is going to support existing and new customers as well largely around AI/ML. And we think those capacity expansions should take care of us through the next couple of years of growth.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Good morning, Todd. That's a very good question. I would say, we're still in the early innings of the upgrade cycle. I mean, and I say that by the fact that it just started about a year or so ago, and given the amount of compute, which makes up about 50% of any data center that needs to kind of get upgraded, I think we're still in the very early innings of that upgrade cycle.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] I thought also its pronounced mostly in EV charging, which is kind of being driven by a slowdown in EV sales and also some of the incentives, at least in the U.S. are slow to get out to the marketplace, that's having some impact as well as the higher interest rates. But we're also seeing a little bit of a slowdown in, I'll call it the broader industrial space, just driven by the burn down of strategic inventory buffers. Again, we expect some new program ramps and the burn down of the buffers for this entire industrial business to start resuming to grow from the back half of the year.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] In terms of comms, it was driven by networking, which is kind of the pull through that we've been mentioning that we would see as a result of AI/ML demand. And within networking, there's, I'll call it, AI/ML networking, which is directly driven and we've seen both in those programs, networking comes in a couple different flavors. The 48 volt is really driven by some of the AI/ML applications and we've certainly seen an uptick in that.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Look, what I can tell you, Matt is, how much square foot we're adding and that the capacity improvements are a couple of folds. One, phase 1, if you will, which is coming online this quarter is about 28,000 square feet of manufacturing space. It's really a AI/ML testing facility. So it's a test farm -- for fully automated test farm for all AI/ML products. So that's coming online right about now.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] My sense is, it's a multi-year process. It's certainly five plus years. And again, across each of the hyperscalers that we're dealing with, each has different appetites and different phases for deployment so that they won't necessarily all overlap at once, which for at least for Celestica should give us many years of growth.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] No. As we head into Q1, we expect communications and networking to actually be up, driven by a hopper scalers, both on 400G and 800G programs and there's also, HPS driven programs. So, as we head into last year, we had some tough comps. Some of those tough comps are lapsing, and now we're seeing comps return to growth.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Okay.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Operator
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a lovely day.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Thank you. I'm pleased that we posted another solid quarter and the momentum is carrying through into the first quarter of 2024 and all through 2024. I'm also pleased by a continued strong execution and courage with a strong market position and growing markets. Thank you again for joining today's call and I look forward to updating you next quarter.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rob Mionis for final closing comments.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Daniel Chan from TD Securities. Please go ahead.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Maxim Matushansky from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Thanks.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] That's a good question. What I can tell you is that 400G is strong throughout the year. 800G is starting to ramp in the first half of the year, very strong in the back half of the year and certainly picking up into ‘25. That would lead me to believe it's a little bit of a blend, but to be frank with you, I'm not entirely sure.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Well, hi, Rob. So with this particular customer, it's a hyperscale of customer, they're making significant investments in AI/ML compute, as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade. And they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand, so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve over time as ebbs and flows in people's investment cycles.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Yeah. Good question. So our industrial business in ‘23, a way of reminder, grew close to 30%. Again, it was fueled by green energy programs, including EV charging, energy storage, energy generation. As we were exiting the year, demand started cycling down in some of these markets and the markets that were really impacted were interest rate sensitive markets, but moreover, because the material environment has dramatically improved, our customers were taking the opportunity to reduce their strategic inventory buffers. We think those buffers will normalize in the first half of the year, and in the second half of the year, we have new programs, ramps planned, which would return the industrial business to growth.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Yeah. Thanks. We've been interlocking with our customers and been investing forward on capacity expansions, mainly in Thailand. We have a couple of phases, and also in Malaysia, a phase is coming online in February, we've been cutting, frankly. So yes, we do have enough capacity, and it's coming online, very much aligned with the demand state, I would say. And these are also highly automated factories, highly automated test centers, so they're really producing a lot of productivity.
(Q&A)[Rob Mionis - President & CEO] Yeah. We've been on our hyperscaler programs. We've actually been winning incremental share. That on top of increased demand strength has both been positive for us and some of the reasons for some of the improved outlook that we're seeing into Q1 and potentially for the full year, hence, that's why we're going to take a quarter to revisit with our customers and take a look at what the full year has to be. But we have been winning some incremental share and been booking a really significant amount of 800G programs.
(Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] 
(Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS, given the large customer accounting for 29%, it's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about the business outside of that large customer, is that driven by the high level of AI compute currently, and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other dynamic going on there?
(Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Okay. Thank you. I'll pass on.
(Q&A)[Robert Young - Canaccord] Okay. Thank you. Yeah. And then the second question, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. You said you're going to revisit the full year outlook, I think in Q1, but the outlook for 5.5% to 6% operating margin seems conservative given, you're doing so well in the enterprise business in CCS at 6.7% and you're entering at 6% and the guide looks like 6%. So it looks as though it's going to decelerate in the back half of the year. Maybe if you could discuss that and I'll pass on.
(Q&A)[Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] 
(Q&A)[Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Great. [indiscernible]
(Q&A)[Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] Hi. Good morning. With respect to the full year guidance, I hear you with respect to wanting to discuss the second half outlook with your customers before revisiting the guidance. But certainly from the demand signals, you're highlighting it seems like it'll be a stronger second half. I guess from your perspective, what might be the key areas of uncertainty you want to further color on before visiting guidance? Would that be on semi and industrial, or which areas would be the biggest source of demand variability as you think about second half?
(Q&A)[Thanos Moschopoulos - BMO] That's helpful. And then on the softness in industrial, just to clarify, is that primarily lead edged in green energy or is that kind of across the board in your various end markets of an industrial?
(Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] 
(Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Appreciate the color. Thanks a lot.
(Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Hi. Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I want to step back from these detailed questions and just ask a question on the hyperscaler market, data -- the global data center market. What's your view on how much of the data center hyperscaler market has been upgraded to support generative AI and large language model processing needs? How far into that cycle would you think we are at this point?
(Q&A)[Todd Coupland - CIBC] Yeah. And the customers in terms of their cycles to get that upgraded a little bit longer than the quarter-to-quarter discussions is, I mean it's obviously going to be demand dependent, but is that a two-year process or five-year process what's the mindset towards getting that upgrade complete?
